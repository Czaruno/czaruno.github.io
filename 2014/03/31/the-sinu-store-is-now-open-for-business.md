As part of our commitment to supporting your business by providing seamless technology solutions, Sinu has created a private store for our customers’ technology needs.

The Sinu Store streamlines the complex process of purchasing technology by offering a select assortment of appropriate IT solutions that we have prescreened to work within your business environment.

We selected the products that will perform most effectively for your organization. We have already taken the time to make sure they have the right configurations and add-ons so they will integrate effortlessly with the current technology we provide as part of the Sinu platform.

The Sinu Store has several offerings – from desktops, to laptops and external hard drives. To further simplify the selection process, we clearly display the added benefits and value associated with an increase in cost for an item.
