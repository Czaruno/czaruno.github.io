["Silcon Valley's Youth Problem,"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/magazine/silicon-valleys-youth-problem.html?_r=0) in this Sunday's (3/16/14) New York Times Magazine, outlines the tension between the old guard and the new guard in tech companies today.

The article quotes Gayle Laakmann McDowell, the chief executive of the website [CareerCup](http://www.careercup.com/): “The older crowd does a better job of building things that feel substantial... The younger culture runs as fast as they can to build something cool."
