*63 percent of American adults – or 89 million people – will purchase technology holiday gifts, CEA predicts.*

According to the 

[Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)®](http://www.ce.org/Research/2013-Market-Outlook-at-CES/Holiday-2014.aspx)

63 percent of American adults – or 89 million people – will purchase technology holiday gifts, CEA predicts. 

total tech spending will increase 2.5 percent from 2013, to reach a record $33.76 billion during the 2014 holiday season.

If your Internet seems a bit bogged down this week, it could be because a record-breaking 103.3 million Americans will shop online between Thanksgiving and Cyber 

Monday

 this year, according to CEA. 

The top five tech products consumers plan to during that time are:

1) Tablets (for the second year in a row)

2) Televisions (moving up from fourth place last year)

3) Laptop/notebook computers

4) Smartphones (jumping six percentage points from last year)

5) Video game consoles (slipping two spots)

If you're looking to purchase technology this holiday, there are several reviews out there to help you with your decision. One of the most comprehensive tech gift guide is from Washington Post tech reporter, Hayley Tsukayama, who does a [series of reports](http://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/business/collection/gift-guide/) covering everything from [smartphones and tablets](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/21/holiday-tech-shopping-smartphones-and-tablets/), to cool [tech gifts under $100](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/21/holiday-tech-shopping-gifts-under-100/), and [interesting gadgets](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-switch/wp/2014/11/21/holiday-tech-shopping-the-view-from-thewirecutter-com/) for the hard-to-buy-for person on your list.

As your tech partner, we would be remiss if we did not mention a few ways you can keep your data safe online when shopping this weekend:

1) Only shop from reputable and recognized online sites;

2) Use a credit card, not debit card, to make purchases because credit cards often come with insurance should your data be compromised;

3) Avoid public Wi-Fi – it is one of the ways hackers steal data from unsuspecting victims; and

4) Create good passwords for any new online accounts you create using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters and two-factor authentication if possible.

See previous Sinu blogs for more detailed information about [creating good passwords](https://sinu2.squarespace.com/blog/2014/9/15/how-secure-is-your-password.html) and [wi-fi security](https://sinu2.squarespace.com/blog/2014/9/3/how-to-protect-your-data-when-using-public-wi-fi.html).

Have a happy and safe holiday!
