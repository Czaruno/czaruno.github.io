For smaller businesses and nonprofits, every penny counts. We’re sure you’ve noticed that, too. That’s why many small businesses and nonprofits have responded to the need to do more with less by outsourcing whatever they could – including their IT department. Managed IT solutions, like Sinu’s Technology Management services, are the new way of ensuring maximum uptime at a minimum spend.

Of course, IT support is necessary for your critical business operations and applications to continue running smoothly. But it costs both time and money to hire the right IT professionals, pay them a full-time salary, and provide the necessary training they need to stay up-to-date on emerging technologies. Although it’s critical to have day-to-day IT support and data backup, that’s still time, effort and resources you’re taking away from your core business goals.

**Predictable performance and a predictable IT spend**

For that reason, Sinu provides an all-inclusive IT solution for small businesses and nonprofits that offers a lot of peace of mind for one fixed monthly fee. Whatever you need to do to run your business, whatever your organization’s goals are, we make sure you have the support you need at a predictable monthly price based on the number of people in your organization. That helps you with budgeting, it’s scalable as your business grows, and it mitigates worry about being hit with unexpected IT costs.

For instance, Sinu’s all-inclusive service includes full-time help desk support, anti-malware and anti-spam solutions, data back-up and security, regular software upgrades and patches, and email setup and support. (You know, all the things you usually need a tech person for.) 

Sinu also provides business intelligence reporting tools, as well as seamless remote-user solutions for your business or nonprofit that help your employees stay connected when on the road or working from home. Our Sinu Magic network monitoring system helps us identify potential issues and address them before they become a problem.

**An all-inclusive IT solution that helps you focus on what’s important**

Whether your organization is a small business or a nonprofit, our technology management services save you time, training and money. You need an IT solution that supports your productivity and allows maximum uptime for your mission-critical applications, but doesn’t cost any more than it has to – and that’s what you’ll get from Sinu.

Sinu can also save you money because we don’t believe that small businesses and nonprofits need to invest heavily in in-house technology infrastructure, which can be expensive to purchase and maintain, as well as high-risk to operate. That’s why our technology management includes a file server appliance that eliminates the need for a server in-house. That’s just one example of the many ways we find to deliver safer, less expensive IT solutions to our customers.

Sinu takes care of your IT needs so you can get back to running your business or working to fulfill your nonprofit’s mission. We think that’s reason enough to say that with Sinu, your new IT partner is your new best friend!
