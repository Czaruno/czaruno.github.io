<p>It’s not the amount of gold that allows the Apple Watch Edition to command $10,000 to $17,000 because there is less gold than what you might find in other jewelry or watches, such as a Rolex, for instance. To make it stronger and lighter, Apple developed a patented new technology to make the gold for its watches by mixing in ceramic particles rather than other metals. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2015/03/08/apple-watch-edition-will-not-be-worth-its-weight-in-gold-but-could-start-at-2999/">Forbes</a>explains the process and can’t help but make the point that the Rolex will still tell time after 20 years and nobody knows how long before the Apple Watch will be obsolete.</p>
