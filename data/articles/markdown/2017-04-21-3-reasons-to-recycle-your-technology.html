<p>With today’s hardware replacement cycle growing shorter and shorter each year, many organizations find themselves with a closet full of old solutions. You don’t want to just throw them out or donate them, as they may contain sensitive data and, if they end up in a land fill, they can release dangerous substances such as lead and mercury into the soil and water supplies. Some cities require special handling of e-waste, including New York City, where it’s illegal to just throw it out in the trash. But for the most part, there is still little regulation around the 9.4 million tons of electronics thrown out annually in the United States.</p>

<p>Whether your city regulates e-waste or not, there are several reasons your organization should recycle your technology: 1) protect sensitive data; 2) get fair market value for used technology; and 3) protect and preserve natural resources.</p>

<p>Sensitive data, whether on a laptop, server or smartphone, needs to be completely erased before you resell or recycle your technology. Professionals can destroy your data and give you a Certificate of Data Destruction for added assurance.</p>

<p>If your organization allows employees to use personal devices for work, it’s important that your employees understand that resetting their devices to factory settings does not guarantee that the information has been completely erased from the device. It is essential to have someone knowledgeable and trusted manage the data erasing process. At Sinu, we partner with <a href="http://4thbin.com">4th Bin</a>, a company providing sustainable technology management solutions, including recycling hardware and data destruction. </p>

<p>There may be a market for your used technology. If you understand the fair market value of your electronics, you can recover the value of your used IT assets before they become e-waste. Many organizations plan to sell their equipment before it becomes obsolete to offset the cost of new equipment. Sinu provides a free Business Intelligence report for our customers called <a href="https://www.sinusupport.com/user?destination=reports">My Computer Replacement Plan </a>to help gauge where technology is in its lifecycle.</p>

<p>To help minimize capital outlay on new equipment, Sinu also has several Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS) offerings – with no upfront costs and no need to budget for support or replacements. (See <a href="https://sinu2.squarespace.com/config/">Sinu Now Provides Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS)</a> for more information about this service.)</p>

<p>Having a plan for recycling your technology that includes properly disposing of electronics is not only better for the environment, but it can also be better for your bottom line while mitigating the risk of having sensitive data fall into the wrong hands. The key is to plan ahead and budget according to hardware replacement cycles. Use the Sinu Store as a guideline of what today’s devices cost and plan to replace 20-30% of your company’s devices yearly to ensure no device is more than 4 years old. (To access the Sinu Store, go to <a href="https://www.sinusupport.com/user?destination=dashboard">Sinu Support </a>and click the STORE tab on the far right.)</p>
