<p>With the dog days of summer upon us, we wanted to share some tips on how to protect your devices from overheating and often irreparable damage.</p>

<p>First, it’s important to know the recommended temperatures for devices so you can avoid extremes: laptops should stay below 122 degrees Fahrenheit, MacBooks between 50 and 95 degrees, and iPhones between 62 and 72 degrees (<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/keep-your-laptop-or-smartphone-safe-in-hot-weather-2378144">Lifewire.com</a>).</p>

<p>Hot vehicles are among the most common places where devices can run afoul of hot temperatures. On a 95 degree day, the temperature inside a car parked in the sun hits an average of 116 degrees within one hour. A car’s dashboard gets even hotter, reaching 157 degrees, and the temperature of a car seat can hit 123 degrees. (Livescience.com)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-keep-your-smartphone-cool-during-hot-summer-months">Androidcentral.com</a> reports, “Overall, it’s best to pre-plan where you’ll put things before you get into the vehicle. If you’re driving long distances, for example, grab a magnetic car mount to keep the phone affixed to the air conditioning vent as you’re using turn-by-turn directions. If you have to leave the phone in the car for safety reasons, try storing it in the trunk instead.”</p>

<p>Glove boxes are, as a rule, the worst places to store electronics. “Glove boxes are hot enough to melt the cassette tapes of yore, and unless you’ve got an air conditioning vent located inside, it’s definitely hot enough to toast your electronics,” Androidcentral.com notes.</p>

<p>Devices – and the humans that own them – are often exposed to higher temperatures this time of year. However, there are a number of ways you can protect your devices in spite of the summer heat.*</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn devices off in extreme heat and try to only use them in the cooler shade.</li>
  <li>Allow time for adjustment so your device can cool off before turning it on.</li>
  <li>Conserve energy by turning off features like Bluetooth, LTE, Wi-Fi, and GPS – these can overtax your laptop or smartphone battery and make it run hotter.</li>
  <li>Use the battery-saving setting on your device to reduce battery use and heat.</li>
  <li>Use the proper support equipment, such as a laptop cooling stand.</li>
  <li>Consider one of several apps that monitor the device’s temperature and control functions to keep heat build-up to a minimum. (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easyx.coolermaster&amp;hl=en">Cooler Master</a>, for Android phones, is a free app that detects and closes heavy resource consuming apps to reduce CPU usage and cool down your phone.)</li>
</ul>
