<p>Small and medium-sized businesses rely on technology to achieve their goals but also find the diversity of choices a challenge, according to a new industry study.</p>

<p>“Technology is a primary driver helping the nation’s small and medium-size businesses (SMBs) to reach their goals, according to new research from <a href="https://www.comptia.org">CompTIA,</a> the leading trade association for the global technology industry,” notes a <a href="https://www.comptia.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/2019/02/26/smbs-see-technology-as-key-to-reaching-new-customers-entering-new-markets-and-streamlining-operations-new-comptia-report-finds">CompTIA press release</a>.</p>

<p>CompTIA – the Computing Technology Industry Association – advocates for the $5 trillion global information technology sector.</p>

<p>“Nearly two-thirds (64 percent) of SMBs indicate technology is a primary factor in pursuing their business objectives, according to the <a href="https://www.comptia.org/resources/smb-technology-buying-trends">CompTIA report “Tech Buying Trends Among Small- and Medium-size Businesses,</a>” the press release notes.</p>

<p>When CompTIA surveyed 650 small and medium-sized businesses across the U.S., they indicated that a top concern was using medium &amp; small business technology effectively.</p>

<p>A 2016 CompTIA survey of the SMB market found that 23 percent of companies reported excelling in technology vision and strategy, however, in the latest survey, that number dropped to 18 percent.</p>

<p>SMBs also report slight drops in proficiency around execution and ongoing management of medium &amp; small business technology.</p>

<p>Carolyn April, senior director for industry analysis at CompTIA, explains, “It’s not that SMBs have gotten less tech-focused or capable, but the sheer number and types of solutions has grown in such size and complexity that many firms are taking two steps forward and one back as they navigate these new learning curves.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-smbs-need-technology-to-hit-business-goals/">TechRepublic</a>, a site devoted to information technology, highlights the report and what it means to small and medium-sized businesses.</p>

<p>More than a third of the small and medium-sized businesses surveyed pointed to purchases related to core infrastructure. Those, TechRepublic, notes, include “mobile phones, laptops, desktops, servers, and networking equipment.” <em>(See CompTIA report: *<a href="https://www.comptia.org/resources/smb-technology-buying-trends">*“Tech Buying Trends Among Small- and Medium-size Businesses*</a></em>”.)*</p>
