<p>Those annoying text messages are popping up on smartphones at an alarming rate and with increasingly deceptive messages that prey on our COVID-19 anxieties and new online habits, however, they are more than an annoyance, these text scams are a real threat to your data, your device, and potentially your organization’s network.</p>

<p>Smishing, which combines SMS and phishing, is not new; however, as we provide our phone number to communicate with more and more legitimate online companies, access to our cell phones becomes easier to access for those looking to access or sell your data or just wreak havoc on your devices.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.fcc.gov/covid-19-text-scams">According to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)</a>, scammers use links in text messages to install malware on your phone or send you to a webpage to trick you into providing personal information, including social security numbers or banking information. Because scammers are clever and count on emotion, panic and fear to get you to click before thinking, fake COVID-19 text messages are especially prevalent right now. The FCC warns, “Do not click on links in texts related to the virus, and check <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fcoronavirus%2Findex.html">cdc.gov/coronavirus</a> for the most current information.”</p>

<p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has also posted <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/03/ignore-bogus-covid-vaccine-survey">an alert about a COVID-19 vaccines scam survey</a>, which explains how people have received emails and text messages asking them to complete a limited-time survey about the Pfizer, Moderna or AstraZeneca vaccine in exchange for a “free reward,” for which they’re asked to pay shipping fees.</p>

<p>Other text scams are impersonating government agencies. The FCC reports that a text scam is circulating that claims to be from the “FCC Financial Care Center” offering $30,000 in COVID-19 relief. And with so much online ordering and packages being delivered, an especially sneaky text came into my phone saying it was from the United States Postal Service (USPS) and they had a package and that I needed to click the link to claim the package. If I hadn’t had my morning coffee, I might have clicked it!</p>

<p>The list goes on and on (and these are just the ones I personally received over the past week) – a free one-year subscription to Hulu because of the pandemic, lose those COVID pounds, receive an Amazon reward, your [insert whatever company you subscribe to that seems legit) account was locked because payment was declined. Someone even tried to recruit me to join the Army (although, I think that one was legit, and I wanted to tell them there is no way I would ever get through boot camp due to those extra pandemic pounds). Netflix has posted an <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/65674">entire webpage</a> to address text scams.</p>

<p>While most of us are aware of the signs of more traditional email phishing attempts – which are often caught by our spam filters along with some messages we might actually want to receive – smishing seems so much more invasive and personal. It is how we communicate with friends, family, and colleagues because it cuts through the email clutter and lands right on someone’s device they have on them.</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/smarter-living/how-to-block-spam-calls-texts.html">New York Times</a>, reporting spam texts could help by deterring some scammers since “most carriers participate in a service that will use this information to try and block future spammers.” The report also notes that when Android users report text messages as spam, “this sends the message to Google as well as your carrier, so Google can improve their spam blocking filters.”</p>
