<p>About 55 million people traveled this past Thanksgiving, and a record breaking 115.6 million will travel from Saturday, December 21 through Wednesday, January 1, <a href="https://newsroom.aaa.com/category/travel/">reports AAA</a>. With so many holiday travelers trying to stay connected – to friends, family, work, their favorite shows – the risks of having personal information stolen or malware installed via public Wi-Fi increases, as well.</p>

<p>For example, these Grinches who steal data will set up “free Wi-Fi” hubs designed to entice unsuspecting people onto their network where they can quickly hijack passwords and other data. Man-in-the-middle attacks are also common, where data is intercepted by third parties. Cybercriminals can also use an unsecured Wi-Fi connection to distribute malware, which can not only affect that individual device but an organization’s network. And the list of risks goes on and on!</p>

<p>However, there are several simple steps you can take to mitigate these risks while using public Wi-Fi networks.</p>

<p><strong>1. Know Your Wi-Fi:</strong> This sounds simple, but wherever possible, use Wi-Fi networks you know and that are secured with a password. Ask your barista for the name of their network to be sure you’re accessing a legitimate one.</p>

<p><strong>2. Turn Off ‘File Sharing’:</strong> Whether you’re on a PC or an Apple computer, you can turn off access to your files from outside parties very quickly by turning off file and printer sharing. <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/tips-to-stay-safe-on-public-wi-fi/">CNET has a good video</a> that walks you through the process.</p>

<p><strong>3. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network):</strong> This is a great option to help protect yourself on public Wi-Fi, while preventing people from knowing who you are or what you’re looking at on the Internet. A VPN essentially creates a secure data tunnel between the end user and the destination. Just be sure to use a reputable, U.S.-based VPN provider.</p>

<p><strong>4. Forget the Network:</strong> On the go, it’s often tempting to just shut off your laptop or device and then just go, but remember to forget the network. On a device, just hold down on the network name until the option pops up. Or, on a computer, go into your network preferences and remove the network from your computer’s memory. This will prevent your computer or device from automatically connecting to that unsecured network in the future.</p>

<p><strong>5. Use a Hotspot:</strong> Most cell phone carriers offer the option for a personal hotspot, turning your cell phone into a mobile Wi-Fi. Be sure to secure the network with a password – if it doesn’t automatically require one – in order to prevent poachers and would-be hackers from logging on.</p>

<p><strong>6. Visit HTTPS</strong>-enabled websites: These sites provide critical security and protect users’ personal information, such as login credentials.</p>

<p>**7. Turn off Wi-Fi auto connect settings and bluetooth discoverability settings: **This helps prevent hackers from gaining direct peer-to-peer access to user devices without them realizing it.</p>

<p>With these few steps, you are on your way to a jollier holiday season. Safe travels from your friends at Sinu!</p>
