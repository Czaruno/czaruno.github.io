<p>Sinu is conducting a <a href="http://www.sinu.com/q2-landing-page-for-nonprofits-fb-survey">survey </a>of nonprofit employees, board members and volunteers to gather data about nonprofits and their technology. The survey should only take about 5-10 minutes. From the aggregated data, we will develop a free report, The State of Nonprofit Technology: An Insiders Perspective. We believe this report will not only help other nonprofits better plan for and utilize technology, but will also help companies like Sinu who support nonprofits with their IT.</p>

<p>We will only use the information in aggregate and will keep an organization’s specific information anonymous. We will also automatically include qualified nonprofits into a random drawing for a $500 donation for those who fill out the survey by July 1, 2018.  Sorry, current Sinu clients can fill out the survey but are not qualified to win the $500 donation. <a href="http://www.sinu.com/2018-sinu-npo-contest">See official contest rules.</a></p>
