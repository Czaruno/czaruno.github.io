<p>The Always Connected PC (ACPC) could change the online experience, eliminating the need for public Wi-Fi and rendering moot those Internet dead zones. It’s “the biggest step forward in mobile technology since the introduction of the smartphone itself,” writes <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3401578/four-reasons-to-buy-an-always-connected-pc.html">PC World</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/Always-Connected-PCs">According to Microsoft</a>, ACPC uses Qualcomm Snapdragon as a power-efficient platform that “ensures lightning-fast LTE connectivity speeds and optimal battery life for thin, sleek devices, while delivering the Windows applications and features you’re used to.”</p>

<p>Basically, a tablet meets a laptop that is as easy to enable as a smartphone with a battery life of up to 20 hours. With a wireless plan, you can remain connected to the Internet. It’s the ultimate road warrior!</p>

<p>The real innovation is in the ACPC processing. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2018/02/21/the-microsoft-and-qualcomm-always-connected-pc-connects-at-mwc/#ba2645a40995">According to Forbes</a>, Microsoft and Qualcomm found a way to run traditional desktop Windows applications by using software that makes the processors typically used by mobile devices, the system on chip (SoC), emulate the types of processors (like AMD and Intel) that run desktops and laptops. The Qualcomm SD835 is the system on chip used in leading Android smartphones and is now used in ACPCs.</p>

<p>“Running Windows on Arm-based SoCs can lower power and reduce system costs, enabling thinner notebooks with longer battery lives. In addition, the SD835 has a built-in cellular modem allowing these notebooks to connect to cellular services in addition to WiFi and Bluetooth… This level of integration is not possible with AMD or Intel chips,” explains <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2018/02/21/the-microsoft-and-qualcomm-always-connected-pc-connects-at-mwc/#2522e32d4099">Forbes</a>.</p>

<p>ACPCs began hitting the market a few years ago, and some of the featured models on the Microsoft site today include the Samsung Galaxy Book 2, HP ENVY x2, and Lenovo Miix 630.</p>

<p>This year, we should expect ACPCs to start hitting their stride and see more devices hitting the market, according to Forbes contributor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/#c8342f616636">Daniel Newman</a>, principal analyst of Futurum Research and CEO of Broadsuite Media Group, foresees quick strides.</p>

<p>Newman sees a growing market of prospective ACPC buyers who will not only value the “all day battery life” and “connectivity characteristics of a smartphone,” but also consumers who need to “tap into the Windows ecosystem, including desktop programs.” He notes that with current ACPC models priced under $1,000, they are competing directly with the Apple iPad Pro line.</p>
