<p><strong>Implementing technology to allow customers to go online to book reservations, deliveries, and curbside pickups – or even do a virtual consultation if you are a professional service – can help streamline your service delivery and help you sustain your business during this challenging time.

<p>Customers make their purchasing choices based on customer experience (CX), which encompasses all the interactions a person has with your brand. With COVID-19, everything is in flux, so customers are increasingly turning to companies that offer reliability and stability as part of that experience.</p>

<p>“With the global pandemic affecting all aspects of our everyday lives, this is easier said than done. The restraints and limitations in place to protect our health and well-being mean that companies must find new and innovative ways to deliver on their brand promise if they are to remain connected to their customer base,” writes Michael Ringman, Forbes Councils Member in a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2020/09/03/how-the-pandemic-is-changing-the-face-of-customer-experience/#202d97355ef9">Forbes</a> article.</p>

<p>Forbes suggests several ways businesses can harness technology to support meaningful connections with their customers and enhance the customer experience:</p>

<p><strong>Leverage technology the “right way”</strong></p>

<p>Ringman tells a first-hand tale of two customer service experiences using technology. One improved his experience, the other turned him off.</p>

<p><em>**The loser</em>: **His auto repair service continued to email him deals (if he spent more money) when all he really wanted to know was the status of the back-ordered parts for his vehicle.</p>

<p><em>**The winner</em>: **The Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), surprisingly provided a great experience. Ringman explains:</p>

<p>“Prior to my arrival, I checked in online and was greeted with an intuitive website that walked me through the required documents and let me schedule my appointment. The day before, I received a friendly text and an email reminder with a QR code. When the time came to go in for my appointment, I was in and out in 10 minutes. This shows that when combined with good customer service, technology can make even the most complicated of experiences simple and painless.”</p>

<p><strong>Combine high tech with high touch</strong></p>

<p>Ringman suggests investing in data and technology that provides more in-depth information about the preferences and behaviors of your customers in order to customize your service. He adds that while machine learning and personalization can lead to more effective interactions with customers, there needs to be a friendly human on the other side of that technology to help close the good customer experience loop.</p>

<p><strong>Use technology to improve efficiency</strong></p>

<p>Create a “seamless customer journey” by decreasing the delays and other headaches some businesses inadvertently cause by using clunky processes. Ringman suggests using artificial intelligence (A.I.) and chatbots to help your organization quickly respond to common customer requests and questions, thereby allowing your employees to focus on more complicated customer service demands.</p>

<p><strong>Ask: Are you providing the best experience?</strong></p>

<p>The constant changes in service delivery required to keep people safe during the pandemic means organizations need to reassess and adjust their practices often, without losing focus of their long-term goals, and when, in many cases, employees are working remotely. It can be overwhelming! However, implementing technology to allow customers to go online to book reservations, deliveries, and curbside pickups – or even do a virtual consultation if you are a professional service – can help streamline your service delivery and help you sustain your business during this challenging time.</p>

<p>“Brands that take proactive steps to address customer concerns demonstrate customer centricity, which earns customer trust and builds relationships. This is especially important at a time when customer needs and sensitivities are so great,” reports Gartner in the article, <a href="https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/embrace-proactive-customer-experience-in-the-midst-of-covid-19/">“Embrace Proactive Customer Experience in the Midst of COVID-19.”</a></p>
