<p>A fondness for the past can mean marketing opportunities in the present.</p>

<p>Nostalgia marketing has been around for decades, but it dominated Super Bowl advertising for the past few years. Remember Super Bowl LII’s ads with Cindy Crawford <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gHYd67OumQ">rebooting</a> her 1992 Pepsi ad, and Steven Tyler from Aerosmith <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=9_dE6Z2HK8I">using a Kia as a time machine back to the 1970s</a>? The following year, there was an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=NvIcPAxZ39o">ad for a new Frito-Lay/Doritos product called Flamin’ Hot Doritos </a>featuring the Backstreet Boys dancing to their 1999 hit “I Want It That Way” and Chance the Rapper explaining the new product. (Was I the only one confused by that ad?)</p>

<p>To lure in new audiences, including millennials, companies are often combining the old with the new. Pokemon Go, for instance, combined a decades-old game with GPS location play and augmented reality. <a href="https://time.com/4402123/pokemon-go-nostalgia/">According to psychologist Clay Routledge</a>, it is “the perfect marriage” of nostalgia and new, exciting technology.”</p>

<p>Nostalgia dominated the Detroit auto show last year where many manufacturers showed models that tapped into fond memories of cars of yesteryear. “Dead cars are coming back to life with a supernatural vengeance,” <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2019/01/14/detroit-auto-show-debuts-retro-cars/2546120002/">USA Today reports,</a> citing comeback models by Chevrolet, Ford, Honda, Jeep and Toyota. And it seems consumers are responding. Earlier this month, the Ford Bronco, which stopped production in 1996, was available with a 2021 model to reserve for $100. Within hours, it was <a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-ford-bronco-first-edition-sold-out-reservations/">sold out</a>.</p>

<p>Once we started looking for nostalgia-based marketing, we began seeing it everywhere. We did a bit of research to understand more about how nostalgia marketing works and explore whether organizations can tap into the power of the past to better connect with customers, especially during COVID-19, when we have had to rethink every detail of how we do business. Our findings are outlined below.</p>

<p><strong>What is nostalgia marketing?</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurenfriedman/2016/08/02/why-nostalgia-marketing-works-so-well-with-millennials-and-how-your-brand-can-benefit/#211596173636">Lauren Freedman of Forbes Magazine</a> defines it well: “tapping into positive cultural memories from previous decades, designed to drive energy to modern campaigns.”</p>

<p>“There are two major styles of nostalgia advertising — the kind that draws on personal, lived experience, and the kind that draws on abstract yearning for generalizations of the past,” explains <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/2/3/18209881/super-bowl-53-ads-nostalgia-stella-artois-backstreet-boys">Vox</a>.</p>

<p>In other words, one is targeted to a specific generation, while the other counts on generalizations and yearning for what seemed like better days or higher quality products – an idealized version of the past. The beauty of it all is that it can appeal to any generation if done well, including millennials and younger.</p>

<p><strong>So how does nostalgia marketing work?</strong></p>

<p>Nostalgia marketing awakens recollections while establishing stability and longevity, explains <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2018/05/24/use-nostalgia-to-improve-your-marketing-results/#4746d27762b9">Jenna Gross </a>in a Forbes, CMO of marketing agency Moving Targets. “The popularity of memory-triggering features on social media platforms attest to the desire of people not only wanting to reflect on the glory days but to do so with friends and family. Facebook’s On This Day app and hashtags like #TBT (throwback Thursday) are popular ways to awaken recollections while establishing stability and longevity.”</p>

<p><strong>How can a business tap into the power of nostalgia?</strong></p>

<p>Gross recommends that businesses explore the history and design of their buildings or neighborhoods, particularly in historic districts; that marketing teams tap throwback photos of team members, especially on social media; and that businesses explore vintage advertisements as a way to evoke nostalgia.</p>

<p>“If possible, share user-generated photos and credit the user for their image,” Gross urges.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.ama.org/marketing-news/5-marketing-opportunities-in-the-covid-19-era/">American Marketing Association</a>, “COVID-19 has required marketers to rethink how their companies go to market and engage with customers. Those marketers who can leverage digital, social and trusted relationships should be well-positioned to navigate ongoing disruptions.”</p>

<p>Because nostalgia marketing is based on the psychology of familiarity and trust, leveraging nostalgia marketing tactics during the pandemic may prove to be an effective way to strengthen customer loyalty and retention, while attracting new customers, as we all “yearn for what seemed like better days.”</p>
