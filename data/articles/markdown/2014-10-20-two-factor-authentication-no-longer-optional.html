<p>As a follow up to our <a href="https://sinu2.squarespace.com/blog/2014/10/9/7-data-security-tips.html">previous blog</a>, we wanted to share a very helpful <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/make-your-cloud-safer-how-to-enable-two-factor-authentication-for-the-most-popular-cloud-services-7000034071/#photo">ZDNet article</a> by Ed Botts who provides step-by-step instructions on two-factor authentication for cloud credentials to help protect online data.</p>

<p>Bott argues that two-factor authentication (2FA) is “no longer optional” to mitigate risk for cloud services, and he has provided a series of images that show exactly how to enable two-factor authentication for some of the most popular cloud-based services including Microsoft Exchange, Google Docs, Office 365, Dropbox, Facebook and Twitter.</p>
