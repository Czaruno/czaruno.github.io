<p><strong>Many organizations are considering how they should prepare for the Coronavirus outbreak and which tools their employees will need to work remotely, if needed. Sinu can help you think about how you can leverage your technology to continue operations. We’ve outlined some steps to help you prepare.</strong></p>

<p>As organizations respond to the coronavirus pandemic, they have turned to Sinu to help determine which tools their employees will need to work remotely and how you can leverage your technology to continue operations. Many companies had to respond quickly to CDC recommendations for remote working, without time to develop a strategic plan. It is not too late to develop and implement a plan that allows as many of your workers as possible to access technological tools that will help them stay connected, productive and safe.  Below we outline some steps to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Employee Health</strong></p>

<p>The primary defense against the virus is prevention, and we recommend a message to employees that stresses the basics of virus prevention: frequent and proper handwashing, enough sleep, healthy diet and care in contact with others. Sick employees should stay home and rest. A good resource in formulating this message is this CDC page:</p>

<p><strong>Remote Work Plan</strong></p>

<p>Planning for an effective work from home strategy requires consideration of two elements:-</p>

<h2 id="employee-requirements-does-each-employee-have-what-they-need-to-work-from-home">Employee Requirements: Does each employee have what they need to work from home?</h2>

<p>Business Solutions: Can each employee access all the business solutions that they need?</p>

<p><strong>Employee Requirements</strong></p>

<h2 id="circumstances-will-vary-but-most-employees-need-all-the-following-to-effectively-work-from-home">Circumstances will vary, but most employees need all the following to effectively work from home:</h2>

<h2 id="a-job-for-which-remote-work-is-practical">A job for which remote work is practical</h2>

<h2 id="an-adequate-computer">An adequate computer</h2>

<h2 id="a-phone-that-can-receive-work-calls">A phone that can receive work calls</h2>

<h2 id="appropriate-installed-software-on-that-computer">Appropriate installed software on that computer</h2>

<h2 id="a-broadband-internet-connections-at-least-5mbps">A broadband Internet connections (at least 5Mbps)</h2>

<h2 id="a-quiet-place-to-work-without-disruption">A quiet place to work without disruption</h2>

<p>Contact information for fellow employees, vendors and customers</p>

<p>Even if your employees have started working remotely, ensure they have what they need by surveying them to determine who has the tools they need to work from home does not so you can provide resources that employees need. Note that laptops are currently already in high demand, and lead times are growing. Consider a work from home policy which addresses how your organization will deal with employees who are unable to work from home.</p>

<p><strong>Business Solutions</strong></p>

<p>Employees will need access to all the business solutions that enable their work. This access will be different for each solution, so list all your business solutions and the means of remote access to identify potential problems. For example:</p>
