<p>Extortion scammers have found a new hook to bait Internet users: old passwords.</p>

<p>“These sorts of online extortion schemes — which try to guilt people into paying off hackers claiming to have compromising information — are nothing new,” writes <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/j-d-biersdorfer">J. D. Biersdorfer</a> in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/technology/personaltech/phishing-password-email.html">The New York Times</a>. “But a new wave of messages that began popping up in mid-July has stepped up the ploy by showing passwords in the subject headers as attention-grabbing ‘proof’ that someone has deeply burrowed into your computer and has your personal information.”</p>

<p>The perpetrators claim to have hacked into a webcam to obtain incriminating video of the victim. Scammers threaten to share the video and stolen passwords with a victim’s contacts unless a hefty payment is made in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Thomas Brewster in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2018/07/31/sextortion-scam-with-hacked-passwords-scores-250000-dollars-for-cybercriminals/#124e3097df16">Forbes</a> writes, “The perpetrators of this particular deception have simply collected passwords from previous data breach leaks. Nevertheless, they’re duping enough people, making more than 30 Bitcoin in a matter of weeks, according to a cybersecurity expert who has been <a href="https://pastebin.com/UyTtLQwL">tracking the attacks</a>.”</p>

<p>The stolen password lure makes this scam particularly tricky, tech writers note.</p>

<p>Jeff Parsons writing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tech/phishing-scam-known-sextortion-using-12928730">The Mirror UK reports</a>, “Where this particular scam gets a bit scary is that often the password quoted at the top of the email can be a legitimate password that the victim has used in the past.”</p>

<p>Parsons adds that the scammers only need a fraction of intended victims to react. “If you receive an email like this, it’s best to ignore it. And most people will, but that doesn’t mean the scammers aren’t making a lot of money out of the sizable minority who panic and pay.”</p>
