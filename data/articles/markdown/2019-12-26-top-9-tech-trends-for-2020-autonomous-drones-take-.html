<p><strong><em>This is the fourth in a series of articles that focus on technology trends you can expect to hear more about over the next 12 months.</em></strong></p>

<p>Drones, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), will become increasingly widespread with more diverse business applications in 2020, experts predict.</p>

<p>In the ten years since the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued the first commercial drone permits in 2006, widespread adoption of drones has been slow, with the exception of military applications, aerial photography and videography, and recreational use.</p>

<p>But that’s about to change. According to a <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeremy-goldman/7-reasons-why-drones-are-future-of-business.html">report by Inc</a>., “drones are going to change everything.”</p>

<p>The report notes that federal regulators predicted there will be about <a href="http://www.techtimes.com/articles/144405/20160326/faa-predicts-drones-will-number-7-million-by-2020.htm">7 million drones in the air </a>by 2020 and that <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/02/28/1401040/0/en/Commercial-Drone-Market-to-hit-17bn-by-2024-Global-Market-Insights-Inc.html">Global Market Insights</a> estimated that the global commercial drone market will reach $17 billion by 2024.</p>

<p>Where will this growth come from?</p>

<p>Agriculture, for one. Whether it’s inventorying crops, irrigation, or monitoring the health of livestock, drones can help expedite time-consuming and expensive projects for farmers.</p>

<p>Drone applications for some high-risk jobs may also help reduce worker deaths and injuries. <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeremy-goldman/7-reasons-why-drones-are-future-of-business.html">Inc. uses</a> roof inspections as an example of a task drones can do more safely than people, and notes that “every year, about <a href="https://www.phpsd.com/blog/8-shocking-roof-safety-statistics-you-won-t-believe">50 roofers are killed on the job</a>, with countless more injured.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9276-commercial-drones-business-uses.html">Business News Daily</a> sees new opportunities for use of drones in healthcare and for emergency responders: “Using drones to get eyes on a difficult situation, or to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/mach/innovation/one-these-drones-just-might-save-your-life-n706206">deliver medical supplies</a> to stranded victims, could enhance the ability of emergency response physicians to offer care in difficult situations.” U.S. firm Zipline has already been using drones to deliver items such as vaccines and blood in Rwanda and Ghana.</p>

<p>Several large companies see drones as a means to increasing internet connectivity, particularly in remote areas. For instance, 5 years ago, Facebook purchased solar-drone company Titan Aerospace with the goal of bringing internet access to the developing world with the Aquila drone, reports Business News Daily.</p>

<p>And, of course, Amazon has high hopes for drones for its delivery service. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Prime-Air/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=8037720011">Prime Air</a> promises to get packages to customers in 30 minutes or less. According to Amazon, “Prime Air has great potential to enhance the services we already provide to millions of customers by providing rapid parcel delivery that will also increase the overall safety and efficiency of the transportation system.” It is speculated that Amazon will roll out the service in select cities “over the next few months,” so we will likely hear more about it – if not see some delivery drones overhead – very soon.</p>

<p>If you’re thinking of getting a drone for your business, there is even Drones-as-a-Service (DaaS). Similar in spirit to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), the company <a href="https://www.measure.com">Measure</a> pioneered this solution to help reduce the risks and costs for businesses wishing to adopt this technology.</p>

<p>But remember, before operating a drone, you need to adhere to a host of <a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/educational_users/">FAA rules and regulations</a>. Depending on the type of drone and its use, you may be required to become an FAA-Certified drone pilot and you will need to register your drone with the FAA.</p>
