<p>As an update to our <a href="https://www.sinu.com/blog/2018/11/19/giving-tuesday-facebook-paypal-promise-7-million-in-matching-donations-to-nonprofits">article</a> preceding #GivingTuesday 2018, the grassroots movement and global day of giving raised nearly $400 million on Tuesday, Nov. 27, up from $300 million in 2017. The <a href="https://www.givingtuesday.org/blog/2018/11/givingtuesday-surpasses-billion-dollars-online-donations-its-inception-most-generous">Giving Tuesday</a> website reports that there were 4 million individual online donations this year – a 45% increase from 2017. The mean gift size was $105.</p>

<p>The movement started at the 92nd Street Y (92Y) in New York City in 2012 to promote giving, and is held on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving. Since that time, the total amount raised from the movement, now an annual ritual around giving, is over $1 billion online in the U.S.</p>

<p>This year, Facebook and PayPal matched donations beginning at 8 a.m. ET on #GivingTuesday 2018 and within seconds they had reached the match. @Facebook <a href="https://twitter.com/facebook/status/1067419087238770688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1067419087238770688&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenonprofittimes.com%2Fnews-articles%2Ffacebook-and-paypal-matches-quickly-hit-limit%2F">tweeted out</a>:</p>

<p>“Wow, that was fast! While the $7M million in matching dollars from Facebook and PayPal was met quickly this morning, every donor and every dollar will help make an impact. So keep up the good work!…”</p>

<p>Henry Timms, Executive Director of 92Y and Co-Founder of #GivingTuesday explains the importance of the movement: “At a time when people’s differences can seem so pronounced, #GivingTuesday demonstrates that everyday acts of compassion can spread, inspire, and bring us closer.”</p>
