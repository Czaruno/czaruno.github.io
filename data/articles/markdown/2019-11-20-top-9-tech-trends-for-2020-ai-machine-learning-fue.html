<p><strong>This is the third in a series of articles that focus on 9 technology trends you will likely hear more about over the next 12 months. In this series of articles, we outline the possible benefits and risks to small businesses and nonprofits, so you can be better prepared to adopt the solutions that best meet your goals and risk tolerance.</strong></p>

<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning no longer exist only in the pages of science fiction, they now represent essential tools for processing massive quantities of information and data. Experts believe that the time is now for companies to adopt AI or they will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage.</p>

<p>“Companies that still aren’t investing heavily in analytics by 2020 probably won’t be in business in 2021,” reports Forbes contributor <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielnewman/#75c679a61663">Daniel Newman</a>, principal analyst of Futurum Research and CEO of Broadsuite Media Group.</p>

<p>While there has been much hype around humans being replaced by machines in the near future, AI is generally seen as a supporting tool that will become much more accessible to small businesses and nonprofits over the coming year or two. AI can process and analyze huge amounts of data far more quickly than a human brain could, and depending on the algorithms, it can then suggest various courses of action, and help streamline the decision-making process. Speed, scale, and convenience for users of AI are what we can expect to see more of in 2020.</p>

<p>We are already familiar with many AI applications, including facial recognition and speech-through-voice technology. However, we have barely scratched the surface for its potential applications.</p>

<p>According to Amir Husain, founder and CEO of machine learning company <a href="https://www.sparkcognition.com/?utm_medium=direct&amp;utm_source=direct">SparkCognition</a> as reported by <a href="https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/9402-artificial-intelligence-business-trends.html">Business News Daily</a>, “Artificial intelligence is kind of the second coming of software… It’s a form of software that makes decisions on its own, that’s able to act even in situations not foreseen by the programmers. Artificial intelligence has a wider latitude of decision-making ability as opposed to traditional software.”</p>

<p>“Those traits make artificial intelligence highly valuable throughout many industries, whether it’s simply helping visitors and staff make their way around a corporate campus efficiently or performing a task as complex as monitoring a wind turbine to predict when it will need repairs,” reports Business News Daily.</p>

<p>AI will play an increasingly important role in a number of day-to-day applications over the next few years, including smart energy management systems, cybersecurity, banking and customer relationship management (CRM) systems. Business News Daily explains, “Software like Salesforce or Zoho requires heavy human intervention to remain up to date and accurate. But when you apply artificial intelligence to these platforms, a normal CRM system transforms into a self-updating, auto-correcting system that stays on top of your relationship management for you.”</p>

<p>So, while AI promises to automate business processes, boost data analysis and improve engagement with customers and employees, humans will still play a key role as companies seek employees who understand AI and its applications, advises the <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/artificial-intelligence-for-the-real-world">Harvard Business Review</a>.</p>

<p>The debate continues about the long-term effects of AI on the workforce, however, there continues to be an important role for humans – at least for the short term – while AI is adopted by more small businesses and nonprofits.</p>
