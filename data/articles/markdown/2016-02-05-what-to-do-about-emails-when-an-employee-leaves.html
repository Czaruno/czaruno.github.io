<p>Departing employees often leave behind vast amounts of information in their email correspondences, so archiving the data is recommended. For continuity, an organization may wish to take some action to deal with emails which continue to arrive at that address after they have left, either with an autoresponder for the ex-employee indicating that he/she has left and who to contact, or by forwarding the emails to another address.  </p>

<p>There are several options for handling a former employee’s email address:  - <strong>STORE, FORWARD AND NOTIFY:</strong> Leave the mailbox open, change the password and forward the mail to an appropriate employee. This can also include an auto-responder message such as “I’ve left the organization, please contact the sales department as follows…” While archiving, forwarding and auto-responder messages have no cost, leaving the mailbox open will incur a monthly mailbox cost.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>ARCHIVE AND FORWARD ONLY</strong>: Archive and delete the mailbox. The data will be backed up and you will have access to the data. Sinu would typically create an alias of the old address to an appropriate employee’s mailbox so that a current employee receives the former employee’s mail.</li>
  <li><strong>ARCHIVE ONLY:</strong> Archive and delete the mailbox. The data will be backed up and you will have access to it. Mail sent to the employee’s address will bounce.   </li>
</ul>

<p>As noted above, one of our many <a href="http://www.sinu.com/technology-management-for-busi/">IT solutions for small businesses</a> is archiving a single email address for a departing employee. However, you may want to consider implementing an organization-wide email archiving system. It is not only easier to retrieve information than a backup, it will also protect against malicious intentional deletion of email data from an unhappy departing employee. We also recommend a yearly review of forwards and old mailboxes to lessen the number of unchecked mailboxes which could cause a missed communication with a customer or donor, not to mention avoiding the unnecessary costs of unused mailboxes.</p>
