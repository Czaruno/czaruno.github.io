<p>There is a growing number of small businesses using remotely-accessed cloud technologies for most, if not all, of their solutions. As we have mentioned in a <a href="/blog/2014/1/7/it-and-the-surge-of-remote-workers.html">previous blog post</a>, cloud technologies can often <a href="/affordable-it-services/">reduce IT costs</a> and increase productivity. In addition, the cloud can offer solutions that support a remote workforce, which in turn allows a company to hire from a larger pool of qualified employees who don’t have to live within commuting distance from a physical office location.</p>

<p>The BBC recently ran a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26716450">story</a> highlighting one small business and its success using cloud technology – exclusively. Babes With Babies, an online retail company for new mothers and mothers-to-be, is run virtually with no physical office and the staff all work remotely. According to an interview with the company’s CEO, Sophie Devonshire, “Business is booming and profitable – the company has enjoyed a sevenfold increase in turnover in the past seven years.”</p>

<p>The report addresses several questions about cloud-based companies and how they can work in practice. For instance, the report asks: “Without a traditional, bricks-and-mortar presence, how does a cloud-based company build customer confidence?” According to Ms. Devonshire, “It’s all about an unremitting focus on customer service.” </p>

<p>While there is a list of practical technology tools listed that the company uses to stay virtually connected, she also says that there is still a role for face-to-face meetings in a cloud-based business.</p>

<p>So, if you are thinking of migrating more services to the cloud, you may be interested in this <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26716450">BBC story</a>. And, of course, we are always here to discuss what cloud strategies make the most sense for your company.</p>
