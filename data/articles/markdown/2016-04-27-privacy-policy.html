<p><strong>Sinu only asks for specific types of personal information</strong>
In a few areas on our Web site and online customer support tools, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit, to assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with you after your visit. We may ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, type of business, customer preference information, customer number and service tag number, as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers. Sinu is the sole owner of this information. We do not sell or share this information with others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.</p>

<p><strong>Sinu only uses your personal information for specific purposes</strong>
The information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with Sinu. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on Sinu.com and alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new products and services from Sinu. Agents or contractors of Sinu who have access to your personal information and prospect information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for Sinu. Sinu may enhance or merge your information collected at its site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing Sinu products or services to you.</p>

New technologies are emerging on the Internet that help us deliver customized visitor experiences. At Sinu, we primarily use “cookies” to help us determine which service and support information is appropriate to your machine and to maintain your browsing experience. Our use of this technology does not mean that we automatically know any information about you. We might be able to ascertain what type of computer you are using, but beyond that, our use of cookies is designed only to provide you with a better experience when using our site. Sinu has no desire or intent to infringe on your privacy while using the site.</p>
