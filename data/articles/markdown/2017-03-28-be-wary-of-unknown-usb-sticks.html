<p>Be wary of the unknown USB device you plug into your computer. These small flash-memory drives used to easily share files from computer to computer have become one of the easiest ways for hackers to install malicious software and gain access to a computer.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hackers-usb-sticks-2016-4">Business Insider</a>, hackers will drop the USB sticks in heavily trafficked locations such as a parking lot or in an airport, hoping for a curious person to pick it up. It could be an off-the-shelf model with malware installed or a specially-designed weaponized USB. </p>

<p>There are three ways these malicious attackers use USB sticks to compromise your data and hardware. </p>

<p>One of these USB stick tricks is basically the same as an email phishing attack. All people need to do is plug in the stick and click on a file the hacker planted there, and once opened, the file will prompt the user to “enable macros.” After this, the document will be able to run malicious software that can do anything from activating the webcam to keeping a running log of keystrokes. This technique is very effective. According to Business Insider, “a recent University of <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/study-finds-48-percent-people-will-plug-a-random-usb-into-their-computer">Illinois study </a>found that nearly 50% of people will pick up a random USB stick and run through all the steps required to have their computer compromised.”</p>
