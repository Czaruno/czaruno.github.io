<p>Cybercriminals have grown more brazen and ambitious in their ransomware attacks — when hackers hold their victims’ data hostage and demand a payment to release it. Increasingly, the attacks are targeting entire networks and cloud services, and not just individual computers. That’s according to the recently released <a href="https://www.vectra.ai/download/2019-spotlight-report-on-ransomware">2019 Spotlight Report on Ransomware</a> from cybersecurity company Vectra, reports <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/ransomware-attacks-are-getting-more-ambitious-as-crooks-target-shared-files/?bhid=24279512040576298636492821239557&amp;ftag=TRE-03-10aaa6b">ZDNet</a>.</p>

<p>In North America, government, manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and energy organizations were particularly targeted during the first half of 2019, ZDNet reports.</p>

<p>The cost of not preparing can be devastating. In just one case, a small medical business in Michigan shut its doors after a ransomware attack froze its records, <a href="http://m.startribune.com/all-of-records-erased-doctor-s-office-closes-after-ransomware-attack/508180992/">The Minneapolis Star Tribune</a> reports. This two-doctor medical practice is reported to be the first healthcare provider in the nation to close because of a ransomware attack.</p>

<p>Install the latest software updates and patches. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/11/small-business-ransomware-attacks-precautions-prevent">The Guardian </a>explains that “hackers are notoriously looking for older systems that they can compromise, and if all of your devices are running the latest and greatest versions of Windows, Mac OS X and macOS then they may ignore you in lieu for another small business that’s easier to infiltrate.”</p>

<p>Equally important is understanding what hardware is related to each business solution in your company. You want to make sure your hardware and other solutions are compatible with any upgrades before installing them, and if any of that hardware is 5-10+ years old, older hardware, like older humans are the most vulnerable to injury. Sinu takes care of these updates automatically for our customers, but if you are managing your IT in-house, <a href="https://www.sinu.com/blog/2016/6/30/top-tech-challenges-of-nonprofits-obsolete-technology">here are a few tips</a> on avoiding obsolete technology.</p>
