<p><strong>“This socially conscious and fast-paced generation requires a set of rules different from those of Generation X and Z.

<hr />

<p>A glut of emails can undermine the best marketing strategy. As <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/315340">Entrepreneur.com reports</a>, the sheer volume of email means potential customers are tougher to hook.</p>

<p>“Years ago, you could achieve email click-through rates of around 5 percent. These days, you’re lucky to get click-through rates of 0.5 percent,” Entrepreneur.com notes.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2019/40748/how-to-keep-your-email-marketing-strategy-relevant-to-millennials">MarketingProfs reports</a> on a possible solution, particularly with the coveted Millennial generation.</p>

<p>Florian Bersier, founder and CEO of Gmail app <a href="https://gmelius.com">Gmelius</a>, writes at MarketingProfs.com, “Email marketing, when it’s done correctly, still holds sway for brands looking to maintain customer relationships, engage audiences, and make sales. Despite the rise of social media and search engine marketing, <a href="https://www.inc.com/peter-roesler/study-shows-email-marketing-still-popular-and-effective-with-millennials.html">email is still a highly effective and popular marketing tool</a> with Millennials.”</p>

<p>Bersier writes that 61 percent of consumers welcome weekly promotional emails, but that Millennials — the generation born after 1980 — pose an extra challenge.</p>

<p>“This socially conscious and fast-paced generation requires a set of rules different from those of Generation X and Z. And brands need to take into account that fact if they want their email marketing strategy to engage this important demographic,” Bersier writes.</p>

<p>His advice: “Optimizing email marketing strategy by using Google’s AMP, sending relevant and personalized content, promoting the company’s own story and values, and enabling customers to move smoothly across different online channels are key components of a successful strategy to keep Millennials engaged and interested in what your brand has to offer.”</p>

<p>AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages, and Bersier embraces this interactive and responsive platform. “By introducing AMP to Gmail, Google now enables its email users to complete tasks directly without needing to leave their inbox: Users are able to RSVP to events, schedule appointments, and fill out questionnaires right from the email message,” Bersier writes.</p>

<p>But marketers need that first click. This can be achieved, Bersier writes, by providing personalized content. “Using a personalized approach in email marketing can determine whether the targeted person opens the email, or sees it as a standard mass-mailed message and sends it to trash,” Bersier writes. “Putting the recipient’s first name in the subject line and providing ‘just for you’ recommendations that have been algorithmically chosen can grab attention and translate to more hard sales.”</p>

<p>Targeting is key, the article concludes.</p>

<p>“Millennials much prefer receiving fewer, tailored messages that relate to their browsing data than they do ‘batch and blast’ emails sent to a huge list,” Bersier writes. “Less is more, in this case; and combining this approach with personalized email increases the likelihood of brand loyalty and meaningful shopping experiences even further.”</p>

<p>Values count with Millennials, Bersier notes, writing that brands should clearly state their ethical business conduct, particularly when marketing to the Millennial generation. Promoting any social impact that they have and environmentally-friendly practices will further engage Millennials.</p>
