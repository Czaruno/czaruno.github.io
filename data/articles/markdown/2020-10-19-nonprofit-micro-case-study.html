<p><strong>Nonprofit Experience: Sinu Case Study</strong></p>

<p>Nearly half of Sinu’s client base is nonprofit customers. As a result, Sinu has a deep knowledge of the technology challenges faced by nonprofits, as well as a large number of the productivity applications utilized in the nonprofit sector.</p>

<p>Recently, Sinu helped a nonprofit customer migrate an aging in-house CRM and communications system to a cloud-based hosted solution, and updated an in-house domain and authentication network.</p>
