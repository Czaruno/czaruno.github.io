<p>Google put together a great little book that covered 20 areas of web browsers and the internet of today.</p>

<p>It is well put together and I think a lot of people don’t know these things but never bother to ask,  or might not be very interested.</p>

<p>We are increasingly moving towards a world where the web and browsers is unavoidable.  It is possible that the generation growing up has an inherent understanding of these things, but I doubt it.  After all most adults today don’t really have any idea how the phone system works - and they use it constantly.</p>

<p>In any case, check out this great little book - you might learn a couple of things.</p>
