<p>Experts agree, technology has provided small business with the edge they need to successfully compete in today’s global economy.</p>

<p><a href="http://fortune.com/2014/11/29/how-the-internet-is-giving-small-business-saturday-an-edge/">Forbes</a> reports, “It used to be that ‘economies of scale’ meant bigger was better. Since the days of Henry Ford, mass production brought down the price of everything from cell phones to washing machines, and big box sellers were the purchase point of choice as a result… But today we find ourselves in an era of ‘unscale,’ where small businesses and entrepreneurs can successfully compete with far larger competitors, as Hemut Taneja of General Catalyst wrote last year in the <a href="https://hbr.org/2013/10/economies-of-unscale-why-business-has-never-been-easier-for-the-little-guy/">Harvard Business Review</a>.”</p>

<p>According to the report, there are several reasons why small businesses are better positioned to compete today.</p>

<p> 1. Small businesses now view their markets as global.</p>

<p><em>Last year, 64% of small businesses reported selling goods or services outside the U.S. (<a href="http://www.nsba.biz/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Exporting-Survey-2013.pdf">National Small Business Association’s (NSBA) 2013 survey</a>), up 12% from 2010. Forecasts predict this increase will continue. </em>    </p>

<p>2.The Internet is only one of the many ways that technology is changing the game for small businesses.</p>

<p><em>Sinu was established over 10 years ago because small businesses and entrepreneurs were often at a competitive disadvantage when it came to technology – it is expensive to buy and maintain computer systems and keep up with changing software and upgrades. Now with the myriad of cloud computing solutions, the question for small business owners in not whether there is a solution out there, but which one and how do you most effectively adopt and <a href="/technology-management-for-busi/">manage these technologies</a> so your employees can maximize productivity using these tools.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li>Small businesses are more nimble than their larger competitors and often well-poised for acquisition.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Because of their scale and large infrastructure investment, large firms often find it harder to innovate and less costly to just buy up new ideas in the form of small companies.</em></p>

<p>Today, with the right technology and support in place, small business owners can spend less time and investment on infrastructure and more time innovating and outselling their larger competitors.
