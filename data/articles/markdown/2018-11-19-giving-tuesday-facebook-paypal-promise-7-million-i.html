<p>On Tuesday, Nov. 27, nonprofit organizations can tap into the power of #GivingTuesday, thanks to a collaboration of Facebook and PayPal. The partners will match a total of up to $7 million in donations made on Facebook to eligible U.S.-based nonprofits.</p>

<p>According to Facebook’s calculations, Giving Tuesday raised about $301 million last year; 15% of the donations for nonprofits were on Facebook. That’s up from 4% of the $180 million that was raised in 2016.</p>

<p>Giving Tuesday falls on the first Tuesday after Thanksgiving and is widely considered both a national day for donating to charity, and an unofficial kick-off for nonprofits ramping up their holiday season and end-of-year fundraising campaigns.</p>

<p>This year, Facebook and PayPal will start matching donations at 8 a.m. ET on Tuesday, Nov. 27, until $7 million in donations is reached or at 11:59pm PT that day. Matches will be paid within 75 days of Giving Tuesday 2018. Nonprofit groups will receive an email notification confirming the match.</p>

<p>For nonprofits that want to participate in an online giving campaign, Facebook provides an <a href="https://fbdonations.files.wordpress.com/2018/10/individual-create-a-fundraiser-guide.pdf">online guide</a> with step-by-step instructions on how to start utilizing Facebook for your nonprofit. If your organization is planning on participating in #GivingTuesday 2018, or in the future, it is recommended that you set up your Facebook donations account and start promoting it to your “friends and family” list and other consistuents as soon as possible, since you will be competing with tens of thousands of other organizations that day for donations. It is worth noting that nonprofits using Facebook Payments to process donations pay no fee.</p>
