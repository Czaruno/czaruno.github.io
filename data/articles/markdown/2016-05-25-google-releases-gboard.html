<p><strong><em>Easier search function for iOS raises privacy concerns</em></strong></p>

<p>Google just released a new keyboard for iOS devices that may well revolutionize an endless chain of events involved in iPhone web searching by keeping the search function right within the Google keyboard itself. They call it the Gboard and it holds promise.</p>

<p>Whether one is searching for the address of a restaurant, or a “You’re Awesome” GIF, Gboard allows the user to search from within the keyboard without leaving the app itself.</p>
