<p>Time is money and tech companies are designing new innovations to save both for small businesses. Whether it’s plugging in your Square to make an on-the-go sale, or managing your payroll from your tablet in a coffee shop, the tech-abilities are endless.</p>

<p>Breaking through the clutter of the new and shiny advancements, <a href="http://blog.surepayroll.com/small-business-owners-favorite-tech-tools-2014/">SurePayroll</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/SurePayroll">@SurePayroll</a>) surveyed small business owners across the country to find out what was working for them – and <a href="http://blog.surepayroll.com/small-business-owners-favorite-tech-tools-2014/">what their top picks are for 2014</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, business leaders prized their company website above all else. Following right behind, the survey found email, social media, online advertising and online video presentation resources to be key. As businesses begin moving their data storage to the cloud, Dropbox continues to reign as the most preferred company. Google is hot on their tail followed by Apple’s iCloud, Microsoft’s OneDrive (which <a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/microsofts-onedrive-android-app-merges-personal-professional/">recently announced a merger</a> of its personal and professional service suite) and then Box.</p>

<p>It was hardly a surprise to see Facebook leading the social media category, followed by LinkedIn. The big surprise is that Google+ came in third beating out Yelp (fourth place) and Twitter (tied for fifth with Quora).</p>

<p>CRM picks started with Salesforce and followed with Act and then NetSuite while email marketing was again dominated by Constant Contact. InfusionSoft and Marketo tied for second place with MailChimp pulling into third place with its quirky personality and free use up to 2,500 emails/month.</p>

<p>Google Drive dominates the organizational app category. Evernote comes in second, followed by Tripit and Trello. The interesting thing to see here is that Microsoft OneNote doesn’t even make it to the list. If this trend continues, Google could well push Microsoft out of the office suite market it has dominated for more than two decades. </p>

<p>Looking at broader tech trends, the survey noted, “that 70 percent of small business owners are changing the way they do business to adjust for a more technology-based market. As many as 80 percent are leveraging mobile technology for their businesses.” <a href="/blog/2014/8/20/the-cloud-an-equalizer-for-small-businesses.html">A recent blog we wrote</a> documented that while cloud use is currently only at 37 percent, that it will reach 80 percent by 2020. </p>

<p>It is interesting to note that most of the favorite small business services listed in this survey are accessible through the cloud and have mobile-friendly versions. Companies are not just simply migrating to the cloud, they are embracing it.  </p>
