<p>I work in sales and marketing at Sinu and was subject to a recent phishing attempt. An email came through the website’s contact form saying we had to pay to renew the web domain or it would be auctioned off. It was not an automatic email… someone had to actually fill in the form and did with complete and coherent sentences that were grammatically correct. I clicked on the link, the webpage looked legitimate, had used some logos of well-known online data security firms, and asked for $93 to renew for the year. Seemed a bit steep, and didn’t I just renew that url?</p>
