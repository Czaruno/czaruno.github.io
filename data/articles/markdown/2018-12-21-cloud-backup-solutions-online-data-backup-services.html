<p>So what exactly is cloud – or online – computer backup service?  Why is it important? We’ve outlined a few of the most frequent questions we get about this service below:</p>

<p><strong>What is online file backup?</strong></p>

<p>Online file backup is the process of storing the contents of your computer’s hard drive, such as your important documents and media files, through the Internet using a third party online cloud file backup service.</p>

<p><strong>Why do I need an online data backup service?</strong></p>

<p>Online data backup solutions provide a simple, secure and economical way to protect all the files on your computer’s hard drive. If your hard drive crashes, your computer is stolen, you accidentally erase important information from your computer or you otherwise lose access to important files, online computer backup services give you the ability to quickly restore any lost information.</p>

<p><strong>Is cloud file backup secure?</strong></p>

<p>Yes. Online cloud backup services utilize the same security measures that financial institutions use to protect sensitive data. This means that the data you store with an online backup service is as secure as your bank account or credit card account information.</p>

<p><strong>How do cloud backup services work?</strong></p>

<p>Cloud backup file services allow you to download a small computer program on your laptop or desktop computer. This application will allow you to select which files you would like to backup and set-up automated scheduled backups of your files. With Sinu, we take care of all the logistics for you and your employees.</p>
