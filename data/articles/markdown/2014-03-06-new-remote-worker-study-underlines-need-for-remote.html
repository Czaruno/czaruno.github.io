<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.npr.org/2014/02/27/283507813/telework-not-just-for-moms-and-millennials">NPR did a story</a>, ”Telework: Not Just For Moms And Millennials,” that cited a recent <a href="http://worklifefit.com/research">study</a>by Flex+Strategy Group/Work+Life Fit Inc. The study is notable because it reports that nearly one-third (31%) of full-time employees do most of their work away from their employer’s location. It also breaks down some of the stereotypes of the remote worker, noting that 71% are men, with no significant difference between those with or without kids nor among the ages of those remote workers. </p>

<p>The NPR story also interviews Jennifer Glass, a professor of sociology at the University of Texas, Austin, who has found that people who telework usually put in more hours than those confined to a desk, yet they indicate they feel a greater sense of balance between work and family. </p>

<p>As an IT management company, we have been advising our customers of this trend and the benefits of putting in place technologies that allow for remote workers to easily access the tools and data they need to be productive and easily collaborate (see the Sinu blog, <a href="/blog/2014/1/7/it-and-the-surge-of-remote-workers.html">“IT and the surge of remote workers</a>”). This is one of many studies indicating that teleworkers can increase productivity and profitability.  </p>

<p>More small businesses and nonprofits are adopting remote worker policies. Fortunately, more cost-effective, remote-friendly business applications and devices are being developed all the time to meet these needs.</p>
