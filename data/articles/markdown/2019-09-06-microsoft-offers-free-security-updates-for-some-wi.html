<p>As a concession to some users, Microsoft is informing customers that they may receive free security updates on Windows 7 for a year.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.sinu.com/blog/2019/8/2/time-is-almost-up-microsoft-urges-window-7-users-to-migrate-to-windows-10">Aug. 2 blog</a>, we explained that after Jan. 14, 2020, Microsoft will not provide security updates or technical support for computers using Windows 7.</p>

<p>“While you could continue to use your PC running Windows 7, without continued software and security updates, it will be at greater risk for viruses and malware. Going forward, the best way for you to stay secure is on Windows 10,” <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-7-end-of-life-support-information">Microsoft announced</a>.</p>

<p>But <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-is-offering-some-enterprise-users-a-one-year-windows-7-extended-security-update-promo/?bhid=24268567224303890132993076173832&amp;ftag=TREc64629f">ZDNet has since reported</a> that customers may qualify for patches.</p>

<p>Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Enterprise Agreement Subscription (EAS) customers who have active subscriptions to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/deploy-enterprise-licenses">Windows 10 E5</a>, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/what-is-microsoft-365-microsofts-most-important-subscription-bundle-explained/">Microsoft 365 E5</a> and <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-add-two-new-microsoft-365-security-compliance-bundles-to-its-line-up/">Microsoft 365 E5 Security </a>may qualify for Windows 7 Extended Security Updates for a year at no additional cost. This promotion runs from June 1 to December 31, 2019.</p>

<p>“Microsoft also is offering <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-to-bring-multi-user-virtualization-to-windows-and-office-with-windows-virtual-desktop/">Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) customers these Windows 7 ESUs for no additional charge for three years as part of their WVD licensing fees,</a>” ZDNet reported. “<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-windows-virtual-desktop-is-now-feature-complete/">WVD is expected to be generally available in September, 2019</a>.”</p>

<p>Without Windows 7 security updates after Jan. 14, 2020, those looking to adapt via Windows 10 can avoid lapses.</p>

<p>As the <a href="https://www.sinu.com/it-support-services">IT managed service provider</a> for hundreds of people at <a href="https://www.sinu.com/technology-management-for-nonp">nonprofits</a> and small businesses, we recommend developing a planned strategy for retiring obsolete technology. Planning ahead can save you time, money and mitigate risk. We recommend a 3- to 4-year lifecycle of desktops, and 1 to 4 years for mobile devices, depending on the device. When developing a technology replacement plan, on average, expect to retire 20 to 30 percent of your technology each year to ensure no device is older than four years old.</p>
