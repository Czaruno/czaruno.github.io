<p>In November, Ethos Capital, a private equity firm, announced its plans acquire the Public Interest Registry (PIR), the agency that operates the dot-org domain, for $1.13 billion dollars.</p>

<p>This resulted in a backlash, not only because of fears that a profit-driven firm would be able to control and profit from nonprofits, but also because of the way it was handled by governing agencies leading up to the deal.</p>

<p>For instance, there have always been price caps placed on dot-org domains to keep attaining them affordable for mission-driven organization. However, on June 30th, “ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers), the non-profit that oversees all domain names on the internet, <a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2019/06/30/domain-overseer-lifts-all-price-caps-on-org-domain-names/">agreed to remove</a> price caps on rates for .org domain names — which were previously pretty cheap. Seems like something a for-profit company might want,” reports <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963881/org-domain-name-registry-sold-for-profit-company-public-interest-registry-ethos-capital">The Verge</a>.</p>

<p>“The day after ICANN killed the price cap, PIR wrote an ‘Open letter to the .org community’ in which it said that it didn’t have any ‘specific plans’ to increase prices for .org domains,” <a href="https://gizmodo.com/private-equity-ghouls-buy-non-profit-that-handles-org-1839860118">reports Gizmodo</a>. “But that commitment could change under a new ownership.”</p>

<p>ICANN also claimed it was surprised to learn Internet Society (ISOC) was shopping PIR for sale. Seems like the right hand didn’t know what the left hand was doing!</p>

<p>Okay, so if you’re wondering how all these alphabet soups are connected and what they are supposed to do, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/dot-org-private-equity-battle.html">The New York Times explains</a>: “Since 2003, dot-org has been run by the Public Interest Registry, which is controlled by the Internet Society, a nonprofit that helps develop internet standards, education programs and policy. The registry holds a contract to manage dot-org, which was renewed last year for 10 more years. With a sale to Ethos Capital, the Internet Society would gain an endowment to fund its operations and get out of the business of operating dot-org.”</p>

<p>And I am sure that made it all clearer!</p>

<p>Well, as you can imagine, internet freedom groups, politicians, nonprofit organizations and concerned citizens responded passionately. According to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/dot-org-private-equity-battle.html">New York Times</a>, “<a href="https://savedotorg.org">Online petitions</a> and letters of concern came from hundreds of organizations, thousands of individuals and <a href="https://www.keypointsabout.org/blog/the-internet-society-pir-and-ethos-respond-to-congressional-letter">four Democrats in Congress</a>, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>Then, last month, ICANN resurfaces, and “now says it is ‘uncomfortable’ with the lack of transparency around the deal and wants ISOC to pump the brakes,” The Verge states in a<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21026939/icann-ethos-capital-dot-org-domain-name-deal"> recent report</a>.</p>

<p>And the latest in this nonprofit online battlefield is that earlier this month, a nonprofit cooperative corporation, including internet pioneers and nonprofit leaders, counter-bid on the Ethos Capital deal.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/technology/dot-org-private-equity-battle.html">The New York Times reports</a>, “The incorporation papers for the new entity, the Cooperative Corporation of .ORG Registrants, were filed this week in California. The goal of the group is not only to persuade the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees internet domain names, to stop the sale. It is also to persuade ICANN to hand it the management of dot-org instead.”</p>

<p>So, the question remains, will nonprofits be forced to pay higher prices for their domains or will another, newly formed nonprofit protect the sanctity of this digital property?</p>
