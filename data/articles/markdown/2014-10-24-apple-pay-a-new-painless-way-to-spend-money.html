<p>Remember your first credit card? That feeling of power and of acceptance into a new financial world, soon enough followed by your first credit card bill – a sometimes harsh reality of that new financial world.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-17/apple-pay-launch-why-retailers-will-love-apples-payment-system#r=nav-r-story">recent report by Business Week</a>, “Researchers have long found that shoppers spend more the further they get from handling actual currency and tend to better remember cash transactions. These tendencies help explain why credit card balances tend to bloat and why casinos use chips in place of money… Behavioral economists have a term for this dynamic: decoupling. The card or app or casino chip mentally separates the consumer from his bank account. The payment is both delayed and bundled with other charges so it doesn’t seem so painful.”</p>
