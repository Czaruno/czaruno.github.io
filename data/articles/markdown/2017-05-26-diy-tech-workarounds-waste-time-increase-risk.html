<p><strong>There are times when I choose to spend time over money, like when I repair my old classic German cars versus taking them to a mechanic, but with only 16 waking hours to create value from each day, I need to make the most of each one. (And I like working on my old Volkswagen.) However, rolling my own music playing solution in lieu of buying an iPad to use the Sonos app is not the way I want to spend my time.</strong></p>

<p>I have the original iPad One which I bought the day Apple first released the iPad. It still works perfectly well but Apple no longer supports it. They forced its obsolescence by no longer supporting the iOS it runs on. Then they created strong incentives for app developers to stop supporting the old iOS versions.</p>
