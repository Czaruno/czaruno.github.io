<p>For the second year in a row, Sinu has been <a href="https://www.crn.com/rankings-and-lists/next-gen-2018.htm">listed on the CRN’s Next-Gen 250</a>. This list recognizes North American technology resellers that have a specialization in emerging technologies, or a transformative business model that allows them to adapt and excel in the ever-changing IT channel community. It’s culled from CRN’s research, analyst interviews and CRN editorial coverage. The purpose of the 2018 Next-Gen 250 list is to showcase those “<em>solution providers that are setting the pace for the rest of the channel in meeting customers’ ever-evolving IT needs.”</em></p>
