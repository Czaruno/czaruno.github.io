<p><strong>Sophisticated phone phishing scams are on the rise and agencies are urging people to be aware of telephone scams from callers posing as Internal Revenue Service agents. Learn more about how these complex phone phishing scams work, how to recognize and report them.</strong></p>

<p>It’s tax season, so you know what that means: Beware of phishing phone calls from callers posing as Internal Revenue Service agents.</p>

<p>Last year, we wrote <a href="https://www.sinu.com/blog/2018/4/9/how-to-sidestep-phone-scams-during-tax-season?rq=phone">an article</a> explaining how the IRS phone scam works. But this year, we are hearing about increasingly sophisticated phone phishing scams involving other government agencies and trusted companies you may already do business with, such as Apple.</p>

<h2 id="the-more-straight-forward-phishing-scams-work-something-like-this">The more straight forward phishing scams work something like this:</h2>

<h2 id="you-receive-a-call-from-a-number-that-looks-like-the-irs-toll-free-number">You receive a call from a number that looks like the IRS toll-free number.</h2>

<h2 id="the-caller-poses-as-an-irs-representative-claiming-that-you-owe-money-to-the-irs">The caller poses as an IRS representative claiming that you owe money to the IRS.</h2>

<p>You are told that you must pay the balance promptly using a pre-loaded debit card or wire transfer or be subject to punishment. They may even threaten to arrest you or suspend your driver’s license.</p>

<p>The IRS reports that they typically send letters and would never use threats.</p>

<p>Social Security imposters employ similar tactics. One of our clients told us that he recently received a voicemail purporting to be an agent of the Social Security Administration. The message stated that his Social Security number had been suspended. He did not call back, then let us know so we could warn others about the scam.</p>

<p>According the <a href="https://blog.ssa.gov/general-warns-public-about-phone-calls-from-oig-imposters/">Social Security Administration</a> this scam is common. “The Social Security Administration (SSA) and its Office of the Inspector General (OIG) have received several reports from citizens across the country about persons receiving phone calls from individuals posing as OIG investigators. The caller indicates an issue exists pertaining to the person’s Social Security account or Social Security number (SSN) and directs the person call a non-SSA telephone number to address the issue,” the agency reports.</p>

<p>None of these claims turn out to be true, the agency cautions. “Citizens should be aware that the scheme’s details may vary; however, citizens should avoid calling the number provided, as the unknown caller might attempt to acquire personal information.”</p>

<p>While many people may be aware of these types of phishing attempts spoofing government agencies, particularly around tax time, we are now hearing about much more sophisticated attempts using the logos of trusted companies you already do business with, as well as what appears to be legitimate company telephone numbers displayed in caller ID.</p>

<p>In one example, <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/01/apple-phone-phishing-scams-getting-better/">Krebs on Security alerts</a> readers about a scam targeting iPhone users.</p>

<p>“A new phone-based phishing scam that spoofs Apple Inc. is likely to fool quite a few people,” the site notes. “It starts with an automated call that displays Apple’s logo, address and real phone number, warning about a data breach at the company.”</p>

<p>In one specific case a phishing phone call went to Jody Westby, the CEO of <a href="https://globalcyberrisk.com/our-team/jody-westby/">Global Cyber Risk LLC</a>, a security consulting firm based in Washington, D.C. Westby told Krebs that she received an automated call on her iPhone warning that multiple servers containing Apple user IDs had been compromised and that she needed to call a 1-866 number before doing anything else with her phone. She followed up with Apple who had no record of calling her and said they don’t initiate calls. But what alarmed her the most was that the fake call was indexed in the iPhone’s ‘recent calls’ list as a previous call from the legitimate Apple Support line.</p>
