<p><strong>Recently, Larry Velez, Sinu CTO,  was educating himself on machine learning regression algorithms, (artificial intelligence software) during lunch (as most people do, right?). What he discovered was stunning. There is a need for A.I. to be better than humans, <em>who carry conscious and unconscious biases</em>. Unchecked, bias data will help shape dangerous, invisible decisions by A.I. that could haunt us for decades to come.</strong></p>
