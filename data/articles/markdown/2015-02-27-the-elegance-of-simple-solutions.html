<p><em>In our new world of connectivity, where the Internet of Everything provides us with the opportunity to control our home’s temperature from work and watch our pets on our smartphones while we are away, I sometimes like to step back and take inventory of what really gets the job done. And sometimes, I find, simpler really is better.</em></p>
