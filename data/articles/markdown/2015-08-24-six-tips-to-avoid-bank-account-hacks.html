<p>Here at Sinu, we spend our time safeguarding critical data so our customers can focus on what they do best - running a business. But often, the greatest threats to our data security come through our email. We’ve all been repeatedly warned to check for suspicious downloads, but often Trojan horses come with a logo from your local bank or credit union. Why rob a bank in person, when you can just politely ask for someone’s account information… and get it?</p>
