<p>The phrase, “simpler is better,” doesn’t apply when you’re deciding how to choose a password.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/these-are-the-most-commonly-hacked-passwords-and-theyre-embarrassingly-weak/">new report from the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre</a>, the cyber arm of the GCHQ intelligence service, reveals the 100,000 most hacked passwords. Not surprisingly, the simplest are easiest to hack.</p>

<p>“In order to nudge tech-savvy people in the right direction when it comes to staying secure online, the NCSC teamed up with Troy Hunt, an Australian cybersecurity expert who created <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords">Pwned Passwords API</a>, to analyze millions of breached accounts worldwide to determine the most common hacked passwords,”<a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/technology/most-hacked-passwords-2019"> Fox Business online reports</a>.</p>

<p>And the top 10 winners for the most hacked passwords:</p>

<p>“Ideally, a password should be composed of a long string (think at least a dozen characters) of seemingly random uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols,” the publication reports. “One of the best and easiest things to do is to create a long password out of an easy-to-remember phrase, then throw in some special characters.”</p>
