<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Thank you for contacting us!  Someone from our sales team will contact you shortly to discuss your IT needs. In the meantime, we welcome you to learn more about how we helped one of our nonprofit customers migrate an aging in-house CRM and communications system to a cloud-based hosted solution.</p>

<p>Our nonprofit clients find that the predictable fixed fee with our IT solutions makes the budgeting process easier—you pay one monthly fee for your outsourced technology services no matter how often you need us. Nearly half of our customers are nonprofit organizations, so we understand the unique needs of people who serve people and can support your mission-critical applications, including Raiser’s Edge, FundEZ, Salesforce.com, Blackbaud, Dropbox, Microsoft 365, Quickbooks, Sage, Google Apps and Donor Perfect.</p>
