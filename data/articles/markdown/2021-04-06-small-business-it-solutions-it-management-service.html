<p>IT Solutions for Creatives</p>

<p>Sinu has over a decade of experience working with creative professionals, including marketers, retailers, filmmakers, music recording executives, designers and architects. Some of the creative people we support have been with us since we began in 2000 because we offer reliable technology and full-time IT solutions for small businesses when and where they need it.</p>

<p>With one of the most inclusive suites of technology services available in the market, you don’t have to worry about your IT: you’ll know your data is safe, the technology is always up-to-date, and your employees get full-time helpdesk support if they need. With Sinu you are free to run your business and do what you love because you have an entire IT team behind you – all for a flat monthly fee that’s typically less than the cost of a single employee.</p>

<p>Sinu understands the unique technology needs of creative professionals. That’s why our small business IT solutions support many industry-specific applications, and why we’re ready to help maximize efficiencies between the Sinu platform and the applications your business may utilize. We support Adobe Creative Cloud, Dropbox, Sage Accounting, AutoCAD, Time and Chaos, Salesforce.com, Microsoft 365, Google Apps, and more.</p>
