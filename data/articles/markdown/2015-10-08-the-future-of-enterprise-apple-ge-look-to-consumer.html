<p>When asked about the future of enterprise technology, the chief executives from two of America’s largest companies agree that it is personalization.</p>

<p>According to a recent <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/business-technology-starts-to-get-personal/?ref=topics&amp;_r=0">New York Times (NYT) report</a>, Tim Cook of Apple and Jeffrey Immelt of General Electric forecast that business technology will take a lesson from consumer Internet by using data to tailor the tech experience for businesses.  </p>

<p>Sinu noted in past blogs that Apple is aspiring to grow sales with new commitments to enterprise technology (see <a href="https://sinu2.squarespace.com/blog/2015/6/10/ios9-apple-eyes-enterprise.html">OS9: Apple eyes enterprise</a> and <a href="https://sinu2.squarespace.com/blog/2015/2/5/apple-ibm-partnership-promises-new-enterprise-solutions.html">Apple-IBM partnership promises new enterprise solutions</a>).</p>

<p>Cook reaffirmed that position at a recent <a href="https://www.box.com/boxworks/">conference for Box</a>, an online storage and collaboration tools company: “We want to make tools to help people change the world, and that means being in the enterprise.” </p>

<p>Cook also noted that the world has changed over the past decade and “there aren’t nearly as many ‘consumer’ and ‘enterprise’ products—instead, corporate and BYOD buyers just look for the best tool for the job,” reported <a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/article/apple-ceo-tim-cook-talks-enterprise-with-box-ceo-aaron-levie/">TechRepublic</a>.</p>
