<p>63 percent of American adults – or 89 million people – will purchase technology holiday gifts, CEA predicts. </p>

<p>total tech spending will increase 2.5 percent from 2013, to reach a record $33.76 billion during the 2014 holiday season.</p>

<p>If your Internet seems a bit bogged down this week, it could be because a record-breaking 103.3 million Americans will shop online between Thanksgiving and Cyber </p>

<p>Monday</p>

<p> this year, according to CEA. </p>

<p>The top five tech products consumers plan to during that time are:</p>

<p>1) Tablets (for the second year in a row)</p>

<p>2) Televisions (moving up from fourth place last year)</p>

<p>3) Laptop/notebook computers</p>

<p>4) Smartphones (jumping six percentage points from last year)</p>

<p>5) Video game consoles (slipping two spots)</p>

<p>If you’re looking to purchase technology this holiday, there are several reviews out there to help you with your decision.

<p>As your tech partner, we would be remiss if we did not mention a few ways you can keep your data safe online when shopping this weekend:</p>

<p>1) Only shop from reputable and recognized online sites;</p>

<p>2) Use a credit card, not debit card, to make purchases because credit cards often come with insurance should your data be compromised;</p>

<p>3) Avoid public Wi-Fi – it is one of the ways hackers steal data from unsuspecting victims; and</p>

<p>4) Create good passwords for any new online accounts you create using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters and two-factor authentication if possible.</p>
