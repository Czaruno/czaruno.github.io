<p>Managed IT Services for Businesses in Connecticut</p>

<p>A secure and reliable network is critical for success, but we don’t believe it is necessary to house and manage all the network equipment in-house because it is often an unnecessary cost and provides an increase risk of downtime and data loss. As part of its all-inclusive service,  Sinu provides to Connecticut businesses the day-to-day managed services and network monitoring they need to keep their business applications running smoothly.</p>

<p>Sinu provides ongoing CTO-level consultation, data back-up and security, email, seamless remote user solutions and other enterprise technology to support small business. With “Sinu Magic” Connecticut network support services, monitoring, and management, we can also prevent problems before they occur, and are positioned to solve issues quickly when they do arise.</p>

<p>We get to know your company or organization and help develop a technology management strategy that supports growth.</p>
