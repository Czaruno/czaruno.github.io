<p>There are 28 million small businesses in the U.S. They are the backbone and spirit of our economy. In fact, they are the very reason Sinu was formed back in 2000 because we wanted to give small businesses an edge by providing the enterprise-level technology and expertise which big business could afford, but were out of reach of most smaller organizations. Each year at this time, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) celebrates National Small Business Week (this year it’s held April 30-May 6). We join the SBA in applauding entrepreneurs and have compiled a few statistics and observations about why small business matters and what makes them important – and distinct – from large corporations. (Note: While SBA defines a “small business” as having less than 500 employees, 98 percent of small businesses have less than 20 employees.)</p>

<p>It’s important to realize that in spite of the doom and gloom you may hear from the media about downsizing and lost jobs, the small business sector is growing rapidly. While corporate America has eliminated 4 million jobs since 1990, small businesses have added 8 million jobs in that same period.</p>
