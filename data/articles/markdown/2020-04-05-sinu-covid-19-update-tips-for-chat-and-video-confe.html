<p><strong>During social distancing caused by COVID-19, many people have turned to Zoom for home, work and education. However, several recent security issues have emerged with this video conferencing platform, so we wanted to share some tips on how to use Zoom in ways that will help mitigate security risks, as well as mention some other video conferencing options.</strong></p>

<p>Sinu has been closely monitoring the dynamic situation of COVID-19. First and foremost, the health and well-being of our employees, customers, and community remain top-of-mind and our highest priority, and we will continue to take guidance from the CDC and local health officials to determine best practices and protocols, while we remain available to assist nonprofits and small businesses with their technology.</p>

<p>We are providing information and best practices around the technologies we are all depending on to support remote work schedules and stay connected and productive during this challenging time</p>

<p>The most urgent requests for information have been around collaborative messaging and video conferencing tools to help employees bridge the distance that working from home has created.</p>

<p>Our recommendation is that you strongly consider a tool that’s already integrated into your mail system. If you use Office 365 for mail, that’s Microsoft Teams. If you use Google Suite for mail, that’s Hangouts Chat and Meet. A competing product, Zoom, is currently the leader in video conferencing, and offers compelling reasons for consideration too. We have outlined these tools below to help you make the right choice for your organization.</p>
