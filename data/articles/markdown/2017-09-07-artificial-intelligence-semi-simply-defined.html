<p><em>Even though Alexa may have been programmed to have the ability to provide pithy comebacks, AI is still in its infancy, but expected to surge over the next few years. According to a new report from <a href="https://www.tractica.com/">Tractica</a>, interest in implementing AI systems is growing among companies and institutions around the world, and the revenue generated from the direct and indirect application of AI software is predicted to grow from $1.4 billion in 2016 to $59.8 billion by 2025…. But what exactly *is</em> Artificial Intelligence, anyway?*</p>

<p>In the epic 1968 sci-fi film directed by Stanley Kubrick, <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(film)">2001: A Space Odyssey</a></em>, the astronaut Dave Bowman asks the rogue supercomputer HAL to let him back inside the spacecraft, and HAL responds, “I’m sorry Dave, I’m afraid I can’t do that.” </p>

<p>Fast forward to today when Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer science fiction but a reality. In a <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2015/07/31/amazon_echo_s_a_i_alexa_throws_shade_when_you_bring_up_hal.html">Slate article</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/Aelkus">Adam Elkus</a>, a Ph.D. student in computational social science at George Mason University and a fellow at New America’s Cybersecurity Initiative, tested how Alexa would respond when referencing the sci-fi film, he writes: “When you say ‘HAL, open the pod bay doors,’ Alexa responds by not only mimicking the first part of HAL’s response—she also reminds you that she is not HAL and we’re not in space.” Check out Elkus’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=13&amp;v=lGejxHjtA7I">video of Alexa’s “snippy” interaction</a> and see if you don’t have flashbacks to<em> 2001</em>.</p>
