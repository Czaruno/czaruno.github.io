<p>Apple and Microsoft are embracing a message that we learned in kindergarten: It’s good to share.</p>

<p>A new iCloud for Windows app, which rolled out on June 11, allows customers of both tech giants to access files and share photos, videos, mail and other information.</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/06/11/apples-all-new-icloud-for-windows-app-now-available-in-the-microsoft-store/">In a blog, Microsoft reports</a>, “Apple and Microsoft are making it easy for customers to access and enjoy the benefits of their iCloud account across their Windows 10 PC and Apple devices with the all-new iCloud for Windows app available today from the Microsoft Store.”</p>

<p>With the<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/icloud/9pktq5699m62?cid=blogicloud&amp;rtc=1&amp;activetab=pivot:overviewtab"> iCloud for Windows app</a> and iCloud Drive, you can access iCloud Drive files from within Windows 10 File Explorer without using storage on your PC. Another convenient features are that you can now select files and folders you may want to keep on your PC and store files in iCloud Drive so you have access to them from an iOS device, a Mac and on the iCloud website.</p>

<p>“The one-time rivals for desktop domination and former smartphone competitors are collaborating to improve the experience for iPhone owners who use Windows 10 PCs,” ZDNet.com reports.</p>

<p>According to Microsoft, the owners of <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-now-on-825-million-devices/">825 million active Windows 10 devices</a> can now share across platforms. Those who also own an Apple iPhone and/or an iPad can use the new iCloud for Windows app.</p>

<p>“While the companies do compete on some technologies – <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/siri-youre-fired-why-apple-needs-a-new-personal-assistant/">Siri versus Cortana</a>, for example – the cloud, Google, and mobile has diminished that rivalry and<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-exec-more-multi-platform-mobile-products-coming-in-2012/"> helped spawn numerous collaborative efforts</a>,” explains ZDNet.com.</p>
