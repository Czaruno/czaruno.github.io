<p>I noticed a new inbox on my iPhone recently (I have two email accounts that I authorize to come into my iPhone – one for business and one personal). It was called My Accurate Forecasts, and when I opened the mailbox, it had a few hundred spam messages.

I did a bit of research to see if this was some sort of iOS malware and this article outlines what I discovered.</p>
