<p>On June 28, 2018 the California Legislature passed the <a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a>, which will go into effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA creates new requirements for identifying, managing, securing, tracking, producing and deleting consumer privacy information. It is clearly influenced by the European Union’s <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/gdpr/">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a>, but even GDPR-compliant businesses will need to update their policies to comply with the CCPA.</p>

<p>The CCPA applies to for-profit businesses that collect and control California residents’ personal information and meet one of these three requirements:-</p>

<h2 id="have-annual-gross-revenues-of-25-million-or-more-or">Have annual gross revenues of $25 million or more; or</h2>

<h2 id="receive-or-disclose-the-personal-information-of-50000-or-more-california-residents-households-or-devices-on-an-annual-basis-or">Receive or disclose the personal information of 50,000 or more California residents, households or devices on an annual basis; or</h2>

<p>Earn 50% or more of their annual revenues from selling California residents’ personal information.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/ccpa-privacy-policy-template/">Robert Bateman</a>: “The CCPA isn’t (only) aimed at businesses based in California. It’s aimed at any business that processes the personal information of consumers in California. So, much like another major California privacy law, the <a href="https://www.termsfeed.com/blog/caloppa/">California Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)</a>, the CCPA applies to businesses all over the world… Your business could be based anywhere from Fresno to France – as long as your services are accessible in California, you could be covered by the CCPA and have to adhere to its requirements.”</p>

<h2 id="know-what-personal-information-is-collected-about-them">Know what personal information is collected about them.</h2>

<h2 id="know-whether-and-to-whom-their-personal-information-is-solddisclosed-and-to-opt-out-of-its-sale">Know whether and to whom their personal information is sold/disclosed, and to opt-out of its sale.</h2>

<h2 id="access-their-personal-information-that-has-been-collected">Access their personal information that has been collected.</h2>

<h2 id="have-a-business-delete-their-personal-information">Have a business delete their personal information.</h2>

<p>Not be discriminated against for exercising their rights under the Act.</p>

<p>If your business qualifies under the CCPA and you do not have a CCPA-compliant privacy policy by the new year, you could be fined up to $2,500 per violation. A violation occurs each time a person accesses a non-compliant website or app, so fines can add up quickly.</p>
