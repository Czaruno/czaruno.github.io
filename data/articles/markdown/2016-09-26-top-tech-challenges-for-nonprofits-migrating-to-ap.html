<p>At Sinu, we have guided our customers though the process of developing and implementing strategic cloud migration plans. We have identified several opportunities with benefits that most of our nonprofits can realize immediately, whether it is through cost savings or reducing the risk of data loss or downtime.</p>

<h2 id="before-migrating-any-of-your-infrastructure-to-the-cloud-it-is-important-to-consider-the-following">Before migrating any of your infrastructure to the cloud, it is important to consider the following:</h2>

<h2 id="what-are-your-organizational-goals-and-how-can-technology-help-achieve-them">What are your organizational goals and how can technology help achieve them?</h2>

<h2 id="what-is-your-current-infrastructure-and-where-is-your-hardware-in-its-replacement-cycle">What is your current infrastructure and where is your hardware in its replacement cycle?</h2>

<p>Do the critical applications you are currently using meet your needs, and do they offer cloud solutions that can offer the same or increased functionality?</p>

<p>Once you assess this information, communicate your vision for a cloud strategy to your management team. If they understand what you want to achieve when moving applications to the cloud solution, whether it’s cost savings, increased functionality, remote access, reduced risk, or a combination of all these benefits, any changes will be more easily embraced and implemented by your team.</p>

<p>Look for opportunities to immediately mitigate the risk of data loss and potential downtime. For nonprofits with fewer than 1,000 employees, we suggest moving at least 80 percent of your basic infrastructure into the cloud solution over the next three years. Email and backup are critical and should be migrated immediately. Payroll is another critical application that can be moved to the cloud to help avoid disruption of compensation for employees even during local outages or disasters.</p>

<p>During the process of developing a cloud migration plan, you will need to assess your current technology, including your hardware and software. For instance, if you have an in-house server that needs to be replaced in the next six months, this is an opportune time to consider migrating that infrastructure to the cloud solution because it will likely save on the capital expense of replacing that server while reducing the risk of data loss.</p>
