<p>RIP, iTunes. Apple will replace its groundbreaking iTunes service with separate applications, the tech giant announced this month.</p>

<p>“After 18 years, Apple is killing iTunes — well, sort of,” <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/03/729290123/itunes-death-is-all-about-how-we-listen-to-music-today">NPR.com reported.</a></p>

<p>“The media management software for most Mac users (and many Windows users) is being broken into separate pieces for separate uses: Music, podcasts and television will soon<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/06/apple-previews-macos-catalina/"> have their own apps</a> on the new Catalina Mac operating system.”</p>

<p>The announcement came at the company’s developers conference in San Jose, Calif., on June 3, and addresses a long-running complaint that the iTunes desktop app is trying to be too many things at once.</p>

<p>Apple also addressed concerns that the iTunes Store (where users purchase songs and albums for download) would be going away in favor of Apple Music (the company’s streaming service). However, the company assured customers that the iTunes Store will remain, as will the music that people bought from it. People will also still be able to buy movies and TV shows in the Apple TV app, and iTunes gift cards will remain active.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/03/tech/itunes-apple-wwdc/index.html">CNN.com also reported on the phaseout of iTunes</a>: “The music industry has changed dramatically since Apple disrupted the way people buy songs and albums nearly two decades ago. So <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/01/business/apple-fast-facts/index.html">Apple is phasing out </a>iTunes in favor of three more modern apps.”</p>

<p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/farewell-itunes-apple-brings-standalone-music-podcasts-and-tv-apps-to-mac/">Techcrunch.com reported on the changes</a>, citing a move toward consumer-focused customization, particularly for the growing podcast market.</p>

<p>“Meanwhile, the Podcasts app for Mac offers a way to search, discover, subscribe and listen to your favorite audio programs, much as it does on iOS. Your listening data will be synced across devices, and you can listen directly in the new app, as well,” the <a href="https://techcrunch.com">techcrunch.com article noted</a>. “But it’s also got a new trick: it will now use machine learning technology to index the spoken words in podcasts. That will allow you to find more podcasts — or even individual episodes — that reflect your interests.”</p>

<p>Like many tech companies, Apple seems to have its sights on growing its share in the entertainment-streaming market.</p>

<p>“Apple has seen a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-biggest-iphone-sales-decline-in-3-years-gartner-says-2019-2">decline in iPhone sales</a> due to a confluence of factors, including fewer buyers in China and an extended upgrade cycle. The company has been rebranding itself as a streaming-entertainment provider, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/06/03/729290123/itunes-death-is-all-about-how-we-listen-to-music-today">NPR.com reported</a>. “And it has made no secret of looking to grow its<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/03/25/706513097/apple-debuts-streaming-video-payment-card-and-news-subscription-services"> services businesse</a>s, including the Apple Music streaming service, a forthcoming TV-streaming service and a magazine subscription service.”</p>

<p>So, once again, we see tech giants shift more of their resources toward customer-focused software and applications, rather than the devices that run the solutions. As we say here at Sinu: “People matter, objects don’t.”</p>
