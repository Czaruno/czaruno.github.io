<p>If you have still not upgraded to Windows 10, you are not alone – in May, Microsoft said <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/05/05/windows-10-now-on-300-million-active-devices-free-upgrade-offer-to-end-soon/?version=meter+at+3&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=abTest_ft_cpb_hd_upsell_0616_krux_ad&amp;referrer=&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click">300 million devices</a> were running Windows 10 which is only a fraction of the roughly 1.5 billion Windows PCs on the market.</p>

<p>Windows 10 is the newest operating system (OS) upgrade that Microsoft released last July. Right now it’s free to upgrade, however, on July 29, Microsoft will start charging $119 for a copy. In spite of the incessant messages encouraging you to upgrade, and the temptation to download ‘10’ before they start charging for it, please wait, and speak with your Sinu Relationship Manager before upgrading so we can check to make sure that it’s compatible with all of the systems, hardware and software that you run in your environment.</p>

<p>Still tempted to hit that UPGRADE button? Here are a few reasons to reconsider and talk to Sinu IT support specialists first…</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/19/technology/personaltech/why-windows-10-upgrades-go-wrong-and-how-to-avoid-it.html?ref=technology&amp;_r=1">New York Times reports</a> that they have received emails every week from readers about upgrade headaches: “Some say that the software system rendered their machines inoperable, while others say it broke compatibility with apps or devices they rely on.”</p>

<p>The Times lists several examples of how Windows 10 had negatively affected their technology: “the system broke her computer’s networking capability and compatibility with a printer… Windows 10took apart two Toshiba laptops ‘piece by piece’… the Wi-Fi stopped working… then the keyboard failed.”</p>

<p><strong>What if, in a weak moment, you did not wait to talk to Sinu and hit upgrade?</strong></p>

<p>A lesser-known feature in Windows 10 is a button to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options?version=meter+at+3&amp;module=meter-Links&amp;pgtype=article&amp;contentId=&amp;mediaId=abTest_ft_cpb_hd_upsell_0616_krux_ad&amp;referrer=&amp;priority=true&amp;action=click&amp;contentCollection=meter-links-click">roll back to the previous version of Windows</a>. In the Settings window, select the Recovery tab, and there will be an option to go back to an older version of Windows. Click “Get started,” and Microsoft will return you to the previous version of Windows. The option to return to a previous version of Windows is available for only one month after an upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

<p><strong>How do I turn off the Windows 10 reminders?</strong></p>

<p>After complaints about being too aggressive with its reminder to upgrade, Microsoft recently clarified the wording of the upgrade reminder to read: “Click here to change upgrade schedule or cancel scheduled upgrade.” Clicking through will let you opt out of the upgrade.</p>

<p>Typically, the most common Windows 10 problems are caused by an incompatibility with your current hardware and software. If you are a Sinu business IT support customer, we already know your system and whether it will play nicely with the upgrade and we can walk you through the options as part of our all-inclusive service. We can also perform any of these listed steps to turn off Windows 10 reminders or revert back to a previous version of Windows – just ask! Remember, contacting your Relationship Manager before upgrading to Windows 10 or any other new technologies can avoid downtime and data loss.</p>
