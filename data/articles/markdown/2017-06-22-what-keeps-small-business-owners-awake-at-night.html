<p>In a recent survey of more than 1,100 U.S. small businesses, Wasp Barcode Technologies produced a <a href="http://www.waspbarcode.com/small-business-report">State of Small Business Report </a>that reports on some of the distinct challenges that small businesses face in <a href="https://www.inc.com/anna-johansson/the-7-biggest-challenges-that-small-business-owners-face-in-2016.html">2016. Inc. summarized the report</a> which shows some of the top challenges for small businesses include hiring new employees (50 percent), increasing profit (45 percent), employee healthcare (43 percent), growing revenue (43 percent), and cash flow (36 percent).  </p>

<p>While many of these concerns will continue to keep entrepreneurs up at night over the next few years, <a href="http://www.smallbizdaily.com/keep-small-business-owners/">according to Greg Petraetis, Chief Operating Officer, Midmarket and Partner Ecosystem, for SAP North America</a>, there are four emerging issues that will surface over the next five years; keeping up with and managing technology is at the heart of several of these concerns.</p>

<p><strong>1. Customer retention</strong></p>

<p>Retaining an existing customer can mean more to the bottom line than a new one. According to Bain &amp; Company, a 5 percent increase in customer retention produces a more than <a href="http://www.bain.com/Images/BB_Prescription_cutting_costs.pdf">25 percent increase in profit</a>. </p>

<p>Petraetis writes, “To reduce churn, you need to be agile and aware of your customers’ wants and needs. New technologies are emerging to help small business owners better understand their customers at an affordable price. It’s helping them quantify data and make smart business decisions.” </p>

<p>How Sinu helps: Sinu offers a number of free Business Intelligence reports to help inform your business decisions, and because we work with hundreds of customers from all industries, we are well versed in a number of solutions that might best help you anticipate your customers’ needs.</p>

<p><strong>2. Developing the right culture and brand</strong></p>

<p>For small business owners, developing a culture that reflects your mission and vision and helps attract and retain both customers and talent is critical to success. </p>

<p>“Whether it’s building a workplace that is diverse and inclusive, defining and executing on your mission of doing business responsibly, or building the culture that you want your business to reflect, building your business’s image will soon be a top priority versus a ‘nice to have’,” Petraetis explains. </p>

<p>How Sinu helps: By providing reliable technology and unlimited support, Sinu contributes to a company culture that supports employee productivity, less stress and overall satisfaction. </p>

<p><strong>3 - Cyberattacks</strong></p>

<p>According to the S.E.C., <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/statement/cybersecurity-challenges-for-small-midsize-businesses.html#_edn16">60 percent of all targeted cyberattacks</a> in 2014 struck a small- or medium-sized business. This number is likely to grow in the coming years as hackers become more sophisticated and businesses move mobile. These attacks are <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/2016/10/23/small-companies-cyber-attack-out-of-business/">reported</a> to have devastating effects: 60 percent of small businesses go out of business within six months of a data breach and it costs on average $690,000 to fix the damage caused by a cyberattack. </p>

<p><strong>4—Finding qualified, tech-savvy employees</strong></p>

<p>While finding and keeping good talent has always kept small business owners awake at night, they now need to look for employees who are fluent in technology.
