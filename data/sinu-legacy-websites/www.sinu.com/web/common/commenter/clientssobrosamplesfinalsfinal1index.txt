<tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td nowrap>03:20PM 06.10.2003</td><td nowrap>Anthony Ramirez II</td><td>I also prefer final 1 over final 2.  
I have the following suggestions: 
1) I feel that the text in the &quot;bread crumb&quot; trail needs to be made more visible as well as the text in the expandable menus.  
2) The dynamic area on the bottom right hand corner (Expo 2003 placeholder) should &quot;move up for aesthetic and technical purposes&quot; as it does in final 2.  
3) I'm not a big fan of the Arial font and I think it feels out of place as the main text.  
4) I prefer the nav bar being alligned with the browser as it is in final 2.
5) Finally, I am in love with the &quot;SoBRO U&quot; sweatshirt the girl is wearing in the bottom right hand corner, it looks great ;)</td></tr>
<tr bgcolor="#cccccc"><td nowrap>05:52PM 06.09.2003</td><td nowrap>Richard</td><td>I prefer this option 1 over option 2 but I'm not crazy about the orange accents. I like the framing around the main text. I would like to the dynamic areas on the right-hand side go right up to the frame instead of having the thin white space in between.

What would the page look like at 1024 X 748?
