<p>This holiday season, hackers created an ingenious way of getting even the most tech and security savvy person to open their virus-laden email. Playing on our natural curiosity, they send emails seemingly from online stores many of us shop at such as Walmart, Target, Home Depot and Costco, confirming an online order. The email asks recipients to “click here” for more information on the order. Each email is properly branded and looks legit, luring email users to click, but their PC computer becomes infected with the malware that powers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asprox_botnet">Asprox spam botnet</a>.</p>
