Sinu was founded in 2000 on a simple premise: people matter, things don’t. In other words, technology is just one more tool to help employee productivity and support the goals of your organization and it’s our job to deliver reliable service for your employees.

In 2000, few people could anticipate the coming decade of technological innovations that would permanently change the landscape of how we do business. Businesses were inundated with new hardware and software – each offering a promise of added employee productivity and business profitability.

To make my point, just take a look at the technological changes over the past decade. In 2000, 134.7 million computers were sold globally, and, in the past decade, it has nearly tripled to 341.3 million (2012). Add tablets and mobile phones, and it is anticipated that 2.4 billion units will be sold in 2013 ([Gartner report](http://sinu.createsend1.com/t/r-l-buyiilk-l-j/)).
