<p>By John Christie, co-founder &amp; COO</p>

<p>Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS) is growing in popularity as businesses rethink their IT investments. Many small businesses and nonprofits have found that they no longer want or need to make large investments in technology hardware that must be replaced on a faster and faster schedule. Sinu now offers Hardware-as-a-Service as an alternate solution for its customers.</p>

<p>The Wall Street Journal ran a three-part series earlier this year, <a href="http://sinu.createsend1.com/t/r-l-xtitduk-l-j/">The Tech Trends That Will Disrupt, Create Opportunities in 2014</a>, listing Hardware-as-a-Service as part of the growing availability of on-demand services and listing some of its benefits: “Hardware-as-a-Service is increasingly joining Software-as-a-Service, creating what some have called ‘IT as a service’…These services will help companies cut costs as they provide access to powerful software programs and the latest technology without having the expense of a large IT staff and time-consuming, expensive upgrades. As a result, IT departments in all industries will be able to focus on business process transformation, which will allow organizations to maximize their return on their technology investments.”</p>

<p>HaaS is not new – you probably already have HaaS and may not realize it! The low purchase price of the iPhone (have you ever had to pay the full replacement cost of a lost phone?), and the “free” set-top DVR powering your cable TV are just two examples. Now your business can experience Haas – and all its benefits – from Sinu for all your critical hardware, including servers, laptops, and desktops. Because Sinu already manages your technology needs, we can identify the best HaaS solutions for your organization.</p>

<p><strong>How does HaaS Work?</strong></p>

<p>Your hardware is as critical to your productivity as the team that supports it. HaaS means that you pay one low monthly fee for the use of your hardware, and Sinu replaces it on a regular schedule. It’s not a lease, but an “evergreen” service in which your hardware is always refreshed before it becomes old and slow and problematic (yes, that’s why we like it too).</p>

<p>Sinu provides the hardware for you as a service, and takes care of the hardware, warranty, and service for the life of the device. We also replace it before the warranty expires, so there are <em>no more huge up-front payments, and no more outdated and poorly performing hardware.</em></p>

<p><strong>What’s the term of the HaaS agreement?</strong></p>

<p>This agreement is effective upon the delivery of the equipment and stays in force indefinitely, unless the agreement is terminated. Your equipment is replaced on a regular schedule for life.</p>

<p><strong>Can I buy out my HaaS hardware?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, you have the option of purchasing the hardware outright at any time. The buyout price will be based on the age and cost of the hardware.</p>

<p><strong>What are the upfront costs?</strong></p>

<p>There are no upfront costs and no need to budget for replacement hardware.</p>

<p><strong>How can I get HaaS?</strong></p>

<p>To purchase Hardware as a Service, visit the Sinu Store at <a href="http://sinu.createsend1.com/t/r-l-xtitduk-l-t/">www.sinusupport.com/store</a>.</p>
