<hr />

<p>Thanks to our customers providing ongoing feedback about our service and our dedicated team of expert technicians, Sinu has exceeded the competition for customer satisfaction four quarters in a row!</p>

<p>In the quarter that ended September 2015, the Sinu team returned its best-ever survey scores for IT remote support, with an average score of 4.89 out of 5.0 compared to the competition’s 4.73.</p>

<p>“We strive to provide the best customer experience possible,” said John Christie, Sinu COO. “We really appreciate the time our customers take to complete our customer service survey and we take it seriously when we don’t see a top rating. Over the years, we have built our customer support infrastructure in response to what our customers need, and we are so pleased to see we are beating the competition. However, we will keep trying to improve, striving for a rating of 5 out of 5!”</p>
