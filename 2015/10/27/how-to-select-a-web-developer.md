*Many Sinu customers have asked us about web development. There are a number of good platform options out there (see [Sinu blog](https://sinu2.squarespace.com/blog/2015/7/21/tips-on-selecting-the-right-website-builder-and-avoiding-cos.html) for more info on website builder solutions), so I would evaluate which platform is right for you based on hosting costs, functionality, and pre-designed templates. Once you have decided on a platform, look for a developer from that ecosystem.*

Many Sinu customers have asked us about web development. There are a number of good platform options out there (see [Sinu blog](https://sinu2.squarespace.com/blog/2015/7/21/tips-on-selecting-the-right-website-builder-and-avoiding-cos.html) for more info on website builder solutions), so I would evaluate which platform is right for you based on hosting costs, functionality, and pre-designed templates. Once you have decided on a platform, look for a developer from that ecosystem.

Several website builder solutions have lists of development shops that they recommend for their specific platforms. There is a [long list](http://specialists.squarespace.com/) of impressive SquareSpace development shops to choose from. Wix provides a list of recommended developers, showcases designs, and you can even get a free quote at [WixArena](http://arena.wix.com/). The [Code Poet Directory](http://directory.codepoet.com/) from Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, lists enterprise-level WordPress professionals, web designers, and developers.

There are also many purpose-built platforms catering to specific industries. For instance, with NationBuilder you can build a website for a nonprofit or political candidate with built-in tools to facilitate fundraising, grassroots engagement, and letter-writing campaigns. NationBuilder has published a [list of several developers](http://nationbuilder.com/experts) for you to select from. 

While Weebly does not have a published list of recommended developers, earlier this year the company launched an [enterprise platform](http://www.weebly.com/industries.html)that combines the drag-and-drop website creation service they are known for with enterprise functionality. Features include a robust permissions system and administrative controls, as well as a suite of APIs that give enterprise customers the ability to integrate Weebly into their existing applications. Weebly is targeting a number of specific industries with its enterprise offering, including real estate agencies, franchises, and educational institutions.
