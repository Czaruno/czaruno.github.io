3-D Printing, or additive manufacturing, is a process that uses a digital file to create three-dimensional objects. Rather than spraying toner on paper, like traditional printers, it puts down layers of something more substantial (such as plastic resin) until the layers add up to an object. The technology was originally used to produce prototypes, but it has advanced so quickly that, in some cases, 3-D printers are replacing traditional manufacturing and building the final products.
