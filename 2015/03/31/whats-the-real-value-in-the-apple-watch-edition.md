[Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonykosner/2015/03/08/apple-watch-edition-will-not-be-worth-its-weight-in-gold-but-could-start-at-2999/)explains the process and can't help but make the point that the Rolex will still tell time after 20 years and nobody knows how long before the Apple Watch will be obsolete.
