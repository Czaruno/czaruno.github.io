While Sinu always offers full-time support and management for its customers as part of its [monthly subscription service](/it-support-services/), we have found that some organizations would like to supplement the Sinu Solution with a dedicated on-site technician. Along with its SaaS (Software as a Service), [HaaS (Hardware as a Service)](/blog/2014/5/30/sinu-now-provides-hardware-as-a-service-haas.html), and unlimited support, Sinu offers 'Tech as a Service' for those businesses and nonprofits that have more demanding on-site technical needs.

With Sinu's 'Tech as a Service,' your organization can have a dedicated on-site technician as a subscription service. There are several benefits to Sinu's 'Tech as a Service' as compared to hiring an in-house technician:- You can choose your tech for as many days as you need – from one to five days per week; 
- The technician is hired by Sinu, so we take care of payroll, insurance, and vacation time; 
- Because the technician is a Sinu employee, he/she will experienced with the Sinu Solution you use daily; and 
- 4) Your organization will continue to have the full support of the Sinu management and support team.
